  abstract = {Motile Escherichia coli placed at one end of a capillary tube containing an energy source and oxygen migrate out into the tube in one or two bands, which are clearly visible to the naked eye and can also be demonstrated by photography, microscopy, and densitometry and by assaying for bacteria throughout the tube. The formation of two bands is not due to heterogeneity among the bacteria, since the bacteria in each band, when reused, will form two more bands. If an anaerobically utilizable energy source such as galactose is present in excess over the oxygen, the first band consumes all the oxygen and a part of the sugar and the second band uses the residual sugar anaerobically. On the other hand, if oxygen is present in excess over the sugar, the first band oxidizes all the sugar and leaves behind unused oxygen, and the second band uses up the residual oxygen to oxidize an endogenous energy source. The essence of the matter is that the bacteria create a gradient of oxygen or of an energy source, and then they move preferentially in the direction of the higher concentration of the chemical. As a consequence, bands of bacteria (or rings of bacteria in the case of agar plates) form and move out. These results show that E. coli is chemotactic toward oxygen and energy sources such as galactose, glucose, aspartic acid, threonine, or serine. The full repertoire of chemotactic responses by E. coli is no doubt greater than this, and a more complete list remains to be compiled. The studies reported here demonstrate that chemotaxis allows bacteria to find that environment which provides them with the greatest supply of energy. It is clearly an advantage for bacteria to be able to carry out chemotaxis, since by this means they can avoid unfavorable conditions and seek optimum surroundings. Finally, it is necessary to acknowledge the pioneering work of Englemann, Pfeffer, and the other late-19thcentury biologists who discovered chemotaxis in bacteria, and to point out that the studies reported here fully confirm the earlier reports of Beijerinck (4) and Sherris and his collaborators (5,6) on a band of bacteria chemotactic toward oxygen. By using a chemically defined medium instead of a complex broth, it has been possible to study this band more closely and to demonstrate in addition the occurrence of a second band of bacteria chemotactic toward an energy source. Beijerinck (4) did, in fact, sometimes observe a second band, but he did not offer an explanation for it.},

  abstract = {Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.},

The algorithm makes use of the contiguous (connected) set of edge segments produced by our parameter-free edge segment detector, the Edge Drawing Parameter Free (EDPF) algorithm; hence the name EDCircles. The proposed algorithm first computes the edge segments in a given image using EDPF, which are then converted into line segments. The detected line segments are converted into circular arcs, which are joined together using two heuristic algorithms to detect candidate circles and near-circular ellipses. The candidates are finally validated by an a contrario validation step due to the Helmholtz principle, which eliminates false detections leaving only valid circles and near-circular ellipses. We show through experimentation that EDCircles works real-time (10\textendash 20ms for 640\texttimes 480 images), has high detection rates, produces accurate results, and is very suitable for the next generation real-time vision applications including automatic inspection of manufactured products, eye pupil detection, circular traffic sign detection, etc.},

Using numerical simulations of the continuum model, we demonstrate the emergence of both half- and full-integer topological defects in polar active matter. Interestingly, we find that crossover from active turbulence with half-to full-integer defects can emerge with the coexistence region characterized by both defect types. These results put forward a minimal, generic framework for studying topological defect patterns in active matter which is capable of explaining the emergence of half-integer defects in polar systems such as bacteria and cell monolayers, as well as predicting the emergence of coexisting defect states in active matter.},

Transcription from the flhB operon and synthesis of flagellin protein similarly peaked in late exponential and early post-exponential phases, respectively. The increase in swimming speed between early-exponential and post-exponential phases was correlated with twofold increases in both flagellar length and flagellar density per cell volume. This increased investment in flagella probably reflects the increased adaptive value of motility in less favorable environments. The decrease in speed between post-exponential and stationary phases was correlated with a threefold decrease in torque produced by the flagellar motors and presumably reflects decreased proton motive force available to stationary-phase cells.},

Recently, microorganisms have been shown to passively exploit and alter these deposition dynamics to increase their survival chances under harshening conditions. Here, we show that, as the droplet evaporation rate slows down, bacterial mobility starts playing a major role in determining the growth dynamics of the edge of drying droplets. Such motility-induced dynamics can influence several biophysical phenomena, from the formation of biofilms to the spreading of pathogens in humid environments and on surfaces subject to periodic drying. Analogous dynamics in other active matter systems can be exploited for technological applications in printing, coating, and self-assembly, where the standard coffee-ring effect is often a nuisance.},

High surface pressure and shear stress from this collapse can damage, or clean, the surface. A porous boundary, such as a filter, would act similarly to a non-porous boundary but with reduced asymmetry and thus reduced effect. Prior research has measured the cleaning effect of bubbles on filters using ultrasonic cleaning, but it is not known how the bubble dynamics are fundamentally affected by the porosity of the surface. We address this question experimentally by investigating how the standoff distance, porosity, pore size and pore shape affect two collapse properties: bubble displacement and bubble rebound size. We show that these properties depend primarily on the standoff distance and porosity of the boundary and extend a previously developed numerical model that approximates this behaviour. Using the numerical model in combination with experimental data, we show that bubble displacement and bubble rebound size each collapse onto respective single curves.},

After such a skin is formed, further extraction of the solvent from the solution caused by evaporation has generally been considered to reduce the pressure in the solution. We have found that, in PMMA/acetone droplet placed on a substrate, the liquid below the skin layer is pushed out as the solvent evaporates further. These phenomena indicate that the pressure in the solution increases by solvent evaporation. It is considered to be caused by the shrinkage and other structural changes taking place in the skin layer.},

Limitations in nanofabrication have thus far hindered the ability to design and program synthetic swimmers with the same abilities. Here we encode multi-behavioral responses in microscopic self-propelled tori using nanoscale 3D printing. We show experimentally and theoretically that the tori continuously transition between two primary swimming modes in response to a magnetic field. The tori also manipulated and transported other artificial swimmers, bimetallic nanorods, as well as passive colloidal particles. In the first behavioral mode, the tori accumulated and transported nanorods; in the second mode, nanorods aligned along the tori's self-generated streamlines. Our results indicate that such shape-programmed microswimmers have a potential to manipulate biological active matter, e.g. bacteria or cells.},

Large ensembles of those entities display a large variety of self-organized, collective phenomena, including the formation of moving polar clusters, polar and nematic dynamic bands, mobility-induced phase separation, topological defects, and mesoscale turbulence, among others. Here, we give a brief survey of experimental observations and review the theoretical description of self-propelled rods. Our focus is on the emergent pattern formation of ensembles of dry self-propelled rods governed by short-ranged, contact mediated interactions and their wet counterparts that are also subject to long-ranged hydrodynamic flows. Altogether, self-propelled rods provide an overarching theme covering many aspects of active matter containing well-explored limiting cases. Their collective behavior not only bridges the well-studied regimes of polar selfpropelled particles and active nematics, and includes active phase separation, but also reveals a rich variety of new patterns.},

To study this collective phenomenon, we use large-scale (up to               N               = 3 \texttimes{} 10               6               ) particle-resolved lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by extended stresslets.

In the dilute limit, we test analytical predictions for a number of static and dynamic properties against our simulation results. For higher swimmer densities, where swimmer-swimmer interactions become significant, we numerically show that the length- and timescales of the turbulent flows increase steeply near the predicted finite-system transition density.},

Dense populations of such ``active particles'' or ``swimmers'' exhibit a rich collective behavior at large scales. Starting with a minimal physical model of a stroke-averaged swimmer in a fluid, we derive a continuum description of a suspension of active organisms that incorporates fluid-mediated, long-range hydrodynamic interactions among the swimmers. Our work demonstrates that hydrodynamic interactions provide a simple, generic origin for several nonequilibrium phenomena predicted or observed in the literature. The continuum model derived here does not depend on the microscopic physical model of the individual swimmer. The details of the large-scale physics do, however, differ for ``shakers'' (particles that are active but not self-propelled, such as melanocytes) and ``movers'' (self-propelled particles), ``pushers'' (most bacteria) and ``pullers'' (algae like Chlamydomonas). Our work provides a classification of the large-scale behavior of all these systems.},

Such quorum sensing is important for the communication and organisation within bacterial populations. In contrast to living systems, where quorum sensing is determined by biochemical processes, the behaviour of synthetic active particles can be controlled by external fields. Accordingly they allow to investigate how variations of a density-dependent particle response affect their self-organisation. Here we experimentally and numerically demonstrate this concept using a suspension of light-activated active particles whose motility is individually controlled by an external feedback-loop, realised by a particle detection algorithm and a scanning laser system. Depending on how the particles' motility varies with the density of neighbours, the system self-organises into aggregates with different size, density and shape. Since the individual particles' response to their environment is almost freely programmable, this allows for detailed insights on how communication between motile particles affects their collective properties.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many animal species organise into disordered swarms, polarised flocks or swirls to protect from predators or optimise foraging. Previous studies suggest that such collective states are related to a critical point, which could explain their balance between robustness to noise and high responsiveness regarding external perturbations. Here we provide experimental evidence for this idea by investigating the stability of swirls formed by light-responsive active colloids which adjust their individual motion to positions and orientations of neighbours. Because their behaviour can be precisely tuned, controlled changes between different collective states can be achieved. During the transition between stable swirls and swarms we observe a maximum of the group's susceptibility indicating the vicinity of a critical point. Our results support the idea of system-independent organisation principles of collective states and provide useful strategies for the realisation of responsive yet stable ensembles in microrobotic systems.},

However, nonuniform evaporation of a multicomponent droplet can generate surface tension gradients that alter this behavior. Here, we explore the rich dynamics of fully miscible, three-component droplets composed of water, ethanol, and propylene glycol on completely wetting glass substrates. These droplets initially spread rapidly but then stop and contract. We experimentally and theoretically investigate this behavior throughout the ternary parameter space at different relative humidities. Evaporation changes the composition of the droplet over space and time, resulting in a reversal of Marangoni flows that ultimately determines the dynamic droplet shape. We illustrate the utility of such dynamics by collecting, aggregating, and removing contaminants from a 4-cm2 area using a single \textmu L-scale droplet.},

The biological and physical properties of tumour cells and their surrounding tissue microenvironments are critical regulators of these outcomes. How biological and physical properties integrate across length scales to shape disease heterogeneity is poorly understood, because few methods can measure, recapitulate and deconvolve these complex factors. In this Review, we classify regulators of cancer into three categories based on scale: tumour-cell-intrinsic, tissue-microenvironment and organism-level sources. For each length scale, we review the current state of the field, describe how engineering strategies can advance our understanding of these phenomena and assess potential avenues for clinical translation. Engineering strategies include analytical methods of measuring the physical properties of cells and their surroundings, biomimetic culture systems and the integration of these approaches with recent advances such as omics and patient-derived organoids. We further discuss epidemiological and training considerations to improve equity in cancer research. Ultimately, bioengineering approaches will help to generate scientific insights and advance precision-medicine-inspired treatments for patients~with cancer.},

  abstract = {Bacterial suspensions show turbulence-like spatiotemporal dynamics and vortices moving irregularly inside the suspensions. Understanding these ordered vortices is an ongoing challenge in active matter physics, and their application to the control of autonomous material transport will provide significant development in microfluidics. Despite the extensive studies, one of the key aspects of bacterial propulsion has remained elusive: The motion of bacteria is chiral, i.e., it breaks mirror symmetry. Therefore, the mechanism of control of macroscopic active turbulence by microscopic chirality is still poorly understood. Here, we report the selective stabilization of chiral rotational direction of bacterial vortices in achiral circular microwells sealed by an oil/water interface. The intrinsic chirality of bacterial swimming near the top and bottom interfaces generates chiral collective motions of bacteria at the lateral boundary of the microwell that are opposite in directions. These edge currents grow stronger as bacterial density increases, and, within different top and bottom interfaces, their competition leads to a global rotation of the bacterial suspension in a favored direction, breaking the mirror symmetry of the system. We further demonstrate that chiral edge current favors corotational configurations of interacting vortices, enhancing their ordering. The intrinsic chirality of bacteria is a key feature of the pairing order transition from active turbulence, and the geometric rule of pairing order transition may shed light on the strategy for designing chiral active matter.},

Leptospira, a slender helical bacterium, swims more rapidly in such an environment than it does in water3, even at viscosities of several hundred centipoise (1 cP = 10-3 kg m-1 s-1). This behaviour is baffling until one realises that solutions of viscous agents are highly structured (gel-like). The solute forms a loose quasi-rigid network easily penetrated by particles of microscopic size. The network can exert forces normal to a segment of the body of a slender cell even when that segment does not possess a component of velocity in the normal direction; hydrodynamic treatments of the motion of microorganisms (or of cilia and flagella) do not apply. Solutions containing highly branched polymers, for example, Ficoll, are much more homogeneous. Here, we will review existing evidence for the gel-like character of viscous agents and describe experiments in which the motion of Leptospira or Escherichia coli are compared in solutions of methylcellulose and Ficoll of the same apparent viscosity. Our data show that solutions of methylcellulose are gel-like even when quite dilute, when the bulk viscosity is as small as 2 cP.},

  abstract = {Birds can experience localized forces against their bodies due to impact against solid objects (like a branch or another bird) or water (during plunge-dives or landings). In this study, we hypothesize that densely packed contour feathers around the bird body would spread localized impact force while diving and maintaining plumage integrity. To test the hypothesis, we performed experiments with individual feathers and elastic beams, and developed a theoretical model to determine the response of feathers during the dive. First, we used a micro computed tomography scanner to characterize the internal structure of the contour feather from a northern gannet and calculate Young's modulus of feathers sampled from different parts of the body. This value was found to be of the order of 10               9               Pa for feathers from chest and belly. Second, we model the feathers as elastic beams taking into account their pre-curvature and non-uniform cross-section. Results from our experiments with polycarbonate beams suggest that the interaction of feathers on the skin patch redistributes the force, thereby reducing the impact on any particular area of the skin. Finally, a theoretical model of multiple overlaying feathers is proposed to quantify the spreading of impact force on the skin of the bird body which shows that the pressure on the skin at the impact point can be reduced by as much as three times the pressure if feathers had been absent.},

Recent work has demonstrated that E. coli, which moves by run-and-tumble dynamics in a homogeneous medium, exhibits a new form of motility when confined in a disordered porous medium: hopping-and-trapping motility, in which cells perform rapid, directed hops punctuated by intervals of slow, undirected trapping. Here, we use direct visualization to shed light on how these processes depend on pore-scale confinement and cellular activity. We find that hopping is determined by pore-scale confinement, and is independent of cellular activity; by contrast, trapping is determined by the competition between pore-scale confinement and cellular activity, as predicted by an entropic trapping model. These results thus help to elucidate the factors that regulate bacterial motion in porous media, and could help aid the development of new models of motility in heterogeneous environments.},

However, how pore-scale confinement alters bacterial motility is unknown due to the opacity of typical 3D media. As a result, models of migration are limited and often employ ad hoc assumptions. Here we reveal that the paradigm of run-and-tumble motility is dramatically altered in a porous medium. By directly visualizing individual Escherichia coli, we find that the cells are intermittently and transiently trapped as they navigate the pore space, exhibiting diffusive behavior at long time scales. The trapping durations and the lengths of ``hops'' between traps are broadly distributed, reminiscent of transport in diverse other disordered systems; nevertheless, we show that these quantities can together predict the long-time bacterial translational diffusivity. Our work thus provides a revised picture of bacterial motility in complex media and yields principles for predicting cellular migration.},

The subsequent surface confined motility is found to be very sensitive to the physico-chemical properties of the interfaces which determine the boundary conditions for the flow. The quantitative understanding of this complex dynamics requires detailed and systematic experimental data to validate theoretical models for both flagellar propulsion and interfacial dynamics. Using a combination of optical trapping and holographic imaging we study the 3D dynamics of wall entrapment of swimming bacteria that are sequentially released towards a surfactant-covered liquid\textendash air interface. We find that an incompressible surfactant model for the interface quantitatively accounts for the observed normal and tangential speed of bacteria as they approach the boundary.

These viscoelastic fluids have been previously shown to affect the swimming kinematics of these microorganisms in non-trivial ways depending on the rheology of the fluid, the particular swimming gait and the structural properties of the immersed body. In this report we put forth a previously unmentioned mechanism by which swimming organisms can experience a speed increase in a viscoelastic fluid. Using numerical simulations and asymptotic theory we find that significant swirling flow around a microscopic swimmer couples with the elasticity of the fluid to generate a marked increase in the swimming speed. We show that the speed enhancement is related to the introduction of mixed flow behind the swimmer and the presence of hoop stresses along its body. Furthermore, this effect persists when varying the fluid rheology and when considering different swimming gaits. This, combined with the generality of the phenomenon (i.e. the coupling of vortical flow with fluid elasticity near a microscopic swimmer), leads us to believe that this method of speed enhancement could be present for a wide range of microorganisms moving through complex fluids.},

The influence of the wall on the near and far fields is discussed. In the far field it is found that a stokeslet aligned parallel to the wall produces a stokes-doublet far-field, whereas a stokeslet normal to the wall produces a combination of a source-doublet and a stokes-quadrupole far-field.

  abstract = {The Helfrich-Hurault (HH) elastic instability is a well-known mechanism behind patterns that form as a result of strain upon liquid crystal systems with periodic ground states. In the HH model, layered structures undulate and buckle in response to local, geometric incompatibilities in order to maintain the preferred layer spacing. Classic HH systems include cholesteric liquid crystals under electromagnetic field distortions and smectic liquid crystals under mechanical strains, where both materials are confined between rigid substrates. However, richer phenomena are observed when undulation instabilities occur in the presence of deformable interfaces and variable boundary conditions. Understanding how the HH instability is affected by deformable surfaces is imperative for applying the instability to a broader range of materials. In this review, the HH mechanism is reexamined and special focus is given to how the boundary conditions influence the response of lamellar systems to geometrical frustration. Lamellar liquid crystals confined within a spherical shell geometry are used as the model system. Made possible by the relatively recent advances in microfluidics within the past 15 years, liquid crystal shells are composed entirely of fluid interfaces and have boundary conditions that can be dynamically controlled at will. Past and recent work that exemplifies how topological constraints, molecular anchoring conditions, and boundary curvature can trigger the HH mechanism in liquid crystals with periodic ground states is examined. The review ends by identifying similar phenomena across a wide variety of materials, both biological and synthetic. The fact that the HH mechanism is a generic and often overlooked response of periodic materials to geometrical frustration is highlighted.},

Through interactions, active particles spontaneously organize in emergent large-scale structures with a rich range of materials properties. The active-matter paradigm is applied to living and nonliving systems over a vast dynamic range, from the organization of subnuclear structures in the cell to collective motion at the human scale. The diverse phenomena exhibited by these systems all stem from the defining property of active matter as an assembly of components that individually and dissipatively break time-reversal symmetry. This article outlines a selection of current and emerging directions in active matter research. It aims at providing a pedagogical and forward-looking introduction for researchers new to the field and a road map of open challenges and future directions that may appeal to those established in the area.},

  abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, occurring from astrophysical to biophysical scales. At the same time, it is widely recognized as one of the key unsolved problems in modern physics, representing a paradigmatic example of nonlinear dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Whereas in the past, most theoretical work in this area has been devoted to Navier\textendash Stokes flows, there is now a growing awareness of the need to extend the research focus to systems with more general patterns of energy injection and dissipation. These include various types of complex fluids and plasmas, as well as active systems consisting of self-propelled particles, like dense bacterial suspensions. Recently, a continuum model has been proposed for such ``living fluids'' that is based on the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, but extends them to include some of the most general terms admitted by the symmetry of the problem [Wensink HH, et al. (2012)               Proc Natl Acad Sci USA               109:14308\textendash 14313]. This introduces a cubic nonlinearity, related to the Toner\textendash Tu theory of flocking, which can interact with the quadratic Navier\textendash Stokes nonlinearity. We show that as a result of the subtle interaction between these two terms, the energy spectra at large spatial scales exhibit power laws that are not universal, but depend on both finite-size effects and physical parameters. Our combined numerical and analytical analysis reveals the origin of this effect and even provides a way to understand it quantitatively. Turbulence in active fluids, characterized by this kind of nonlinear self-organization, defines a new class of turbulent flows.},

The flow motion inside the blood drop is observed and analysed with the use of a digital camera: the influence of the red blood cells motion is revealed at the drop periphery as well as its consequences on the final stage of drying. The mechanisms which lead to the final pattern of the dried blood drops are presented and explained on the basis of fluid mechanics in conjunction with the principles of haematology. The blood drop evaporation process is evidenced to be driven only by Marangoni flow. The same axisymmetric pattern formation is observed, and can be forecast for different blood drop diameters.

The long-range spatial order arises from interactions between two multicellular aggregate structures: a 'swarm ring' that expands radially, and focal aggregates that have lower mobility. Patterning occurs through alternating domination by these two sources of excreted attractant (which we identify here as aspartate). The pattern geometries vary in a systematic way, depending on how long an aggregate remains active; this depends, in turn, on the initial concentration of substrate (here, succinate).},

The probe has a thermal diffusivity DP=kBT/{$\zeta$}P, where kBT is the thermal energy of the solvent and {$\zeta$}P is the Stokes drag coefficient for the probe. When the swimmers are inactive, collisions between the probe and the swimmers sterically hinder the probe's diffusive motion. In competition with this steric hindrance is an enhancement driven by the activity of the swimmers. The strength of swimming relative to thermal diffusion is set by Pes=U0a/DP. The active contribution to the diffusivity scales as Pe2s for weak swimming and Pes for strong swimming, but the transition between these two regimes is nonmonotonic. When fluctuations in the probe motion decay on the time scale {$\tau$}R, the active diffusivity scales as ksTs/{$\zeta$}P: the probe moves as if it were immersed in a solvent with energy ksTs rather than kBT.},

The comparison between the two approaches displays a fairly good agreement and in particular, we show that the Fokker\textendash Planck approach can predict the structure of the system both in the wall region and in the bulk-like region where the surface forces are negligible. The simultaneous presence of thermal noise and active forces determines the formation of a layer, extending from the walls towards the bulk, where the system exhibits polar order. We relate the presence of such ordering to the mechanical pressure exerted on the container's walls and show how it depends on the separation of the boundaries and determines a Casimir-like attractive force mediated by the active suspension.},

We assume pair-wise repulsive forces among particles, modelling the steric interactions among microswimmers. This system has been experimentally studied in the case of a dilute suspension of Janus particles confined through acoustic traps. We observe that already in the dilute regime - when inter-particle interactions are negligible - increasing the persistent time, {$\tau$}, pushes the particles away from the potential minimum, until a saturation distance is reached. We compute the phase diagram (activity versus interaction length), showing that the interaction does not suppress this delocalization phenomenon but induces a liquid- or solid-like structure in the densest regions. Interestingly a reentrant behavior is observed: a first increase of {$\tau$} from small values acts as an effective warming, favouring fluidization; at higher values, when the delocalization occurs, a further increase of {$\tau$} induces freezing inside the densest regions. An approximate analytical scheme gives fair predictions for the density profiles in the weakly interacting case. The analysis of non-equilibrium heat fluxes reveals that in the region of largest particle concentration equilibrium is restored in several aspects.},

The chirality modeled by means of an effective torque term leads to a drastic reduction in the accumulation near the walls with respect to the case without handedness and to the appearance of currents parallel to the container walls accompanied by a large accumulation of particles in the inner region. In the case of two-dimensional chiral particles confined by harmonic walls, we determine the analytic form of the distribution of positions and velocities in two different situations: a rotationally invariant confining potential and an infinite channel with parabolic walls. Both these models display currents and chirality induced inner accumulation. These phenomena are further investigated by means of a more realistic description of a channel, where the wall and bulk regions are clearly separated. The corresponding current and density profiles are obtained by numerical simulations. At variance with the harmonic models, the third model shows a progressive emptying of the wall regions and the simultaneous enhancement of the bulk population. We explain such a phenomenon in terms of the combined effect of wall repulsive forces and chiral motion and provide a semiquantitative description of the current profile in terms of effective viscosity of the chiral gas.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been discovered that systems of active Brownian particles (APB) at high density organise their velocities into coherent domains showing large spatial structures in the velocity field. This collective behavior occurs spontaneously, i.e. is not caused by any specific interparticle force favoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in the absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces could be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis that velocity alignment is a robust property of ABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal fluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the P\'eclet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled particles, is not sufficient to fully characterize this phenomenon either in the regimes of large viscosity or small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity domains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity correlation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases and decreases as the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that, contrary to the common belief, the spatial velocity correlation not only depends on inertia but is also non-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We conclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems, variations in the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as independent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of the spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent and active temperatures.},

  abstract = {We investigate a two-dimensional system of active particles confined to a narrow annular domain. Despite the absence of explicit interactions among the velocities or the active forces of different particles, the system displays a transition from a disordered and stuck state to an ordered state of global collective motion where the particles rotate persistently clockwise or anticlockwise. We describe this behavior by introducing a suitable order parameter, the velocity polarization, measuring the global alignment of the particles' velocities along the tangential direction of the ring. We also measure the spatial velocity correlation function and its correlation length to characterize the two states. In the rotating phase, the velocity correlation displays an algebraic decay that is analytically predicted together with its correlation length, while in the stuck regime, the velocity correlation decays exponentially with a correlation length that increases with the persistence time. In the first case, the correlation (and, in particular, its correlation length) does not depend on the active force but the system size only. The global collective motion, an effect caused by the interplay between finite-size, periodicity, and persistent active forces, disappears as the size of the ring becomes infinite, suggesting that this phenomenon does not correspond to a phase transition in the usual thermodynamic sense.},

The propagator is then expressed as a combination of the equilibrium eigenstates with weights obeying exact iterative relations. We show that for the low-order correlation functions, such as the positional autocorrelation function, the recursion terminates at finite order in the P\'eclet number, allowing us to generate exact compact expressions and derive the velocity autocorrelation function and the time-dependent diffusion coefficient.

Among these, a significant class execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight path for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating the process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is diffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically, motility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local environment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady state is reached, this is not generally invariant under time reversal: the principle of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal symmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile bacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy that drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller. Here I review some statistical\textendash mechanical models for bacterial motility, presenting them as a paradigm for exploring diffusion without detailed balance. I also discuss the extent to which statistical physics is useful in understanding real or potential microbiological experiments.},

These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motilityinduced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variablespeed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

To model this, we take an overdamped harmonically trapped particle subjected to a thermal and a non-equilibrium noise arising from the active bath. The harmonic well can be attributed to a laser trap or to the small amplitude motion of the sedimented colloid at the bottom of the capillary. In the long time, the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state that can be described by an effective temperature. By adopting this notion of effective temperature, we investigate whether fluctuation relations for entropy hold. In addition, when subjected to a deterministic time dependent drag, we find that transient fluctuation theorem for work cannot be applied in conventional form. However, a steady state fluctuation relation for work emerges out with a renormalized temperature.},

However, previous research focuses on the pinch-off mechanism of drops from a non-wettable nozzle. Here we investigate the formation of a liquid droplet from a wettable nozzle. In the experiments, drops forming from a wettable nozzle initially climb the outer walls of the nozzle due to surface tension. Then, when the weight of the drops gradually increases, they eventually fall due to gravity. By changing the parameters such as the nozzle size and fluid flow rate, we have observed different behaviors of the droplets. Such oscillatory behavior is characterized by an equation that consists of capillary force, viscous drag, and gravity. Two asymptotic solutions in the initial and later stages of drop formation are obtained and show good agreement with the experimental observations.},

A limited set of water birds exhibit this behavior, and only one family of seabirds (Sulidae) exhibit this behavior at high speeds. We studied the stability of the bird's slender and seemingly fragile neck during a plunge-dive by conducting simple experiments that mimic this behavior. An elegant analysis of the interaction among hydrodynamic forces, neck elasticity, and muscle contraction reveals that seabirds dive at appropriate speeds to avoid injury. Considering the popular recreational sport of diving, we also find a diving speed limit for humans to avoid injury.           ,              In nature, several seabirds (e.g., gannets and boobies) dive into water at up to 24 m/s as a hunting mechanism; furthermore, gannets and boobies have a slender neck, which is potentially the weakest part of the body under compression during high-speed impact. In this work, we investigate the stability of the bird's neck during plunge-diving by understanding the interaction between the fluid forces acting on the head and the flexibility of the neck. First, we use a salvaged bird to identify plunge-diving phases. Anatomical features of the skull and neck were acquired to quantify the effect of beak geometry and neck musculature on the stability during a plunge-dive. Second, physical experiments using an elastic beam as a model for the neck attached to a skull-like cone revealed the limits for the stability of the neck during the bird's dive as a function of impact velocity and geometric factors. We find that the neck length, neck muscles, and diving speed of the bird predominantly reduce the likelihood of injury during the plunge-dive. Finally, we use our results to discuss maximum diving speeds for humans to avoid injury.},

Yet, there is no common groundwork that clarifies the physical constraints required to jump out of water. In this study, we elucidate the physical conditions required for an animal to jump out of water. More than 100 jumps are analysed over five taxonomic groups. By balancing the power produced by animals with drag-induced dissipation, we expect that maximum jumping height,               H               , scales with body length,               L               , as               H               /               L               {$\sim$}               L               -1/3               {$\sim$} Fr               2               , where the Froude number, Fr, is a ratio of inertia to gravity. To identify jumping regimes, simplified experiments are conducted by shooting axisymmetric bodies through the water surface. Here, we see a transition in which partial exits scale as               H               /               L               {$\sim$} Fr and complete exits scale as               H               /               L               {$\sim$} Fr               2               . A bioinspired robotic flapping mechanism was designed to mimic the fast motion of impulsive jumping animals. When exiting water, the robot carries a large volume of fluid referred to as an entrained mass. A theoretical model is developed to predict the jumping height of various water-exiting bodies, which shows that the mass of the entrained fluid relative to the mass of the body limits the maximum jumping height. We conclude that the lack of entrained fluid allows animals to reach extraordinary heights compared to our water-exiting robots.},

Many researchers have studied the energetics or diving depths of certain species, but none have addressed the impact forces, internal stresses, or fluid mechanics associated with this process. We attempt to simulate a simplified model of a diving bird. Our model consists of 2 small, hydrophobic spheres joined by an elastic polymer beam, similar in shape to a dumbbell. As this structure is released from a controlled height and impacts the water, we are able to see how the surface impact forces affect the dumbbell structure, causing the beam to buckle. We find that, while some birds have a very high flexural rigidity of their spine, allowing them to withstand the impact forces, other birds do not. Instead, they must make use of their neck muscles and geometrical advantages to minimize impact on the spine.},

  abstract = {The drying of a drop of blood or plasma on a solid substrate leads to the formation of interesting and complex patterns. Inter- and intra-cellular and macromolecular interactions in the drying plasma or blood drop are responsible for the final morphologies of the dried patterns. Changes in these cellular and macromolecular components in blood caused by diseases have been suspected to cause changes in the dried drop patterns of plasma and whole blood, which could be used as simple diagnostic tools to identify the health of humans and livestock. However, complex physicochemical driving forces involved in the pattern formation are not fully understood. This review focuses on the scientific development in microscopic observations and pattern interpretation of dried plasma and whole blood samples, as well as the diagnostic applications of pattern analysis. Dried drop patterns of plasma consist of intricate visible cracks in the outer region and fine structures in the central region, which are mainly influenced by the presence and concentration of inorganic salts and proteins during drying. The shrinkage of macromolecular gel and its adhesion to the substrate surface have been thought to be responsible for the formation of the cracks. Dried drop patterns of whole blood have three characteristic zones; their formation as functions of drying time has been reported in the literature. Some research works have applied engineering treatment to the evaporation process of whole blood samples. The sensitivities of the resultant patterns to the relative humidity of the environment, the wettability of the substrates, and the size of the drop have been reported. These research works shed light on the mechanisms of spreading, evaporation, gelation, and crack formation of the blood drops on solid substrates, as well as on the potential applications of dried drop patterns of plasma and whole blood in diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Powered by flagella, many bacterial species exhibit collective motion on a solid surface commonly known as swarming. As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper-flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. Less studied, however, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and their counterpart planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in circular microwells allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. On a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain Enterobacter sp. SM3 in swarming and planktonic states exhibited different motion patterns when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 mm and 90 mm, swarming SM3 formed a single-swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 formed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across several other species of gramnegative bacteria. We also observed `rafting behavior' of swarming bacteria upon dilution. We hypothesize that the rafting behavior might account for the motion pattern difference. We were able to predict these experimental features via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with stronger cell\textendash cell alignment interaction. Our experimental design using PDMS microchip disk arrays enabled us to observe bacterial swarming on murine intestinal surface, suggesting a new method for characterizing bacterial swarming under complex environments, such as in polymicrobial niches, and for in vivo swarming exploration.},

A low-intensity cavitation process with air being injected into water was studied to determine the microbubbles' efficiency when detaching L. monocytogenes from stainless steel and the surface of fresh cucumber and avocado. Stainless steel coupons (1{${''}$} \texttimes{} 2{${''}$}), cucumber, and avocado surfaces were inoculated with L. monocytogenes (LCDC strain). After 1, 24 or 48 h, loosely attached cells were washed off, and inoculated areas were targeted by microbubbles (\textasciitilde 0.1\textendash 0.5 mm dia.) through a bubble diffuser (1.0 L air/min) for 1, 2, 5, or 10 min. For steel, L. monocytogenes (48 h drying) detachment peaked at 2.95 mean log reduction after 10 min of microbubbles when compared to a no-bubble treatment. After 48 h pathogen drying, cucumbers treated for 10 min showed a 1.78 mean log reduction of L. monocytogenes. For avocados, L. monocytogenes (24 h drying) detachment peaked at 1.65 log reduction after 10 min of microbubbles. Microbubble applications may be an effective, economical, and environmentally friendly way to remove L. monocytogenes, and possibly other bacterial pathogens, from food contact surfaces and the surfaces of whole, intact fresh produce.},

The exponentially correlated active noise extremely simplifies the theoretical description of immersed passive objects but so far lacks direct experimental verification. Here, we experimentally investigate the active noise subjected by a passive rotor confined in an active granular bath. On the basis of Langevin dynamics, we extract the characteristic of the active noise by analyzing the power spectrum of the rotor trajectory. Our experimental results find that the active noise experienced by the granular rotor does show an exponential time correlation to a good extent, even though due to the small experimental system and low collision frequency, the profile of the active noise in our system is non-Gaussian. Our findings give direct experimental evidence, which supports the widely-used active Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck particle model in our dry active system.},

  abstract = {Swimming microorganisms have been previously observed to accumulate along walls in confined systems both experimentally and in computer simulations. Here, we use computer simulations of dilute populations for a simplified model of an organism to calculate the dynamics of swimmers between two walls with an external fluid flow. Simulations with and without hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are used to quantify their influence on surface accumulation. We found that the accumulation of organisms at the wall is larger when HIs are included. An external fluid flow orients the organisms parallel to the fluid flow, which reduces the accumulation at the walls. The effect of the flow on the orientations is quantified and compared to previous work on upstream swimming of organisms and alignment of passive rods in flow. In pressure-driven flow, the zero shear rate at the channel center leads to a dip in the concentration of organisms in the center. The curvature of this dip is quantified as a function of the flow rate. The fluid flow also affects the transport of organisms across the channel from one wall to the other.},

  abstract = {Unlike equilibrium statistical mechanics, with its well-established foundations, a similar widely-accepted framework for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (NESM) remains elusive. Here, we review some of the many recent activities on NESM, focusing on some of the fundamental issues and general aspects. Using the language of stochastic Markov processes, we emphasize general properties of the evolution of configurational probabilities, as described by master equations. Of particular interest are systems in which the dynamics violate detailed balance, since such systems serve to model a wide variety of phenomena in nature. We next review two distinct approaches for investigating such problems. One approach focuses on models sufficiently simple to allow us to find exact, analytic, non-trivial results. We provide detailed mathematical analyses of a onedimensional continuous-time lattice gas, the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP). It is regarded as a paradigmatic model for NESM, much like the role the Ising model played for equilibrium statistical mechanics. It is also the starting point for the second approach, which attempts to include more realistic ingredients in order to be more applicable to systems in nature. Restricting ourselves to the area of biophysics and cellular biology, we review a number of models that are relevant for transport phenomena. Successes and limitations of these simple models are also highlighted.},

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over repeated rounds of subculture with immigration. Consistent with theory, we find a transition exists between neutral and selective regimes, and the crossover point depends on the fraction of immigrants and the magnitude of fitness differences. Neutral models predict an increase in diversity with increased carrying capacity, while our selective model predicts a decrease in diversity. The community here lost diversity with an increase in carrying capacity, highlighting that using the correct model is essential for predicting community response to change. Together, these results emphasize the importance of including selection to obtain realistic models of even simple systems.},

We explore the weakness of the legacy blood models, and then, we apply this newly improved model to recently published data from the literature in order to demonstrate its efficacy in modeling steady state, transient, and oscillatory shear flow. Following this effort, we demonstrate a novel approach using the sequence of physical phenomena (SPP) to facilitate interpretation, characterization, mapping, and ``fingerprinting'' of transient blood data from the literature. We compare the SPP approach to other LAOS analysis techniques in the literature and show how our approach can function as a mechanical-property diagnostic blood analysis tool. The goal of this work is a deeper understanding of the microstructural basis and validity of structural thixotropic blood models, and transient flow analysis techniques and procedures.},

In this paper, we derive a generalized version of the fluctuation theorem for stochastic, microscopically reversible dynamics.

  abstract = {We consider a Brownian particle which, in addition to being in contact with a thermal bath, is driven by fluctuating forces which stem from active processes in the system, such as self-propulsion or collisions with other active particles. These active fluctuations do not fulfill a fluctuation-dissipation relation and therefore play the role of a nonequilibrium environment, which keeps the system permanently out of thermal equilibrium even in the absence of external forces. We investigate how the out-of-equilibrium character of the active matter system and the associated irreversibility is reflected in the trajectories of the Brownian particle. Specifically, we analyze the log ratio of path probabilities for observing a certain particle trajectory forward in time versus observing its time-reversed twin trajectory. For passive Brownian motion, it is well known that this path probability ratio quantifies irreversibility in terms of entropy production. For active Brownian motion, we show that in addition to the usual entropy produced in the thermal environment, the path probability ratio contains a contribution to irreversibility from mutual information ``production'' between the particle trajectory and the history of the nonequilibrium environment. The resulting irreversibility measure fulfills an integral fluctuation theorem and a second-law-like relation. When deriving and discussing these relations, we keep in mind that the active fluctuations can occur either due to a suspension of active particles pushing around a passive colloid or due to active self-propulsion of the particle itself; we point out the similarities and differences between these two situations. We obtain explicit expressions for active fluctuations modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we illustrate our general results by analyzing a Brownian particle which is trapped in a static or moving harmonic potential.},

  abstract = {Bacteria swim by rotating long thin helical filaments, each driven at its base by a reversible rotary motor. When the motors of peritrichous cells turn counterclockwise (CCW), their filaments form bundles that drive the cells forward. We imaged fluorescently labeled cells of Escherichia coli with a high-speed charge-coupled-device camera (500 frames/s) and measured swimming speeds, rotation rates of cell bodies, and rotation rates of flagellar bundles. Using cells stuck to glass, we studied individual filaments, stopping their rotation by exposing the cells to high-intensity light. From these measurements we calculated approximate values for bundle torque and thrust and body torque and drag, and we estimated the filament stiffness. For both immobilized and swimming cells, the motor torque, as estimated using resistive force theory, was significantly lower than the motor torque reported previously. Also, a bundle of several flagella produced little more torque than a single flagellum produced. Motors driving individual filaments frequently changed directions of rotation. Usually, but not always, this led to a change in the handedness of the filament, which went through a sequence of polymorphic transformations, from normal to semicoiled to curly 1 and then, when the motor again spun CCW, back to normal. Motor reversals were necessary, although not always sufficient, to cause changes in filament chirality. Polymorphic transformations among helices having the same handedness occurred without changes in the sign of the applied torque.},

  abstract = {When vegetative bacteria that can swim are grown in a rich medium on an agar surface, they become multinucleate, elongate, synthesize large numbers of flagella, produce wetting agents, and move across the surface in coordinated packs: they swarm. We examined the motion of swarming Escherichia coli, comparing the motion of individual cells to their motion during swimming. Swarming cells' speeds are comparable to bulk swimming speeds, but very broadly distributed. Their speeds and orientations are correlated over a short distance (several cell lengths), but this correlation is not isotropic. We observe the swirling that is conspicuous in many swarming systems, probably due to increasingly long-lived correlations among cells that associate into groups. The normal run-tumble behavior seen in swimming chemotaxis is largely suppressed, instead, cells are continually reoriented by random jostling by their neighbors, randomizing their directions in a few tenths of a second. At the edge of the swarm, cells often pause, then swim back toward the center of the swarm or along its edge. Local alignment among cells, a necessary condition of many flocking theories, is accomplished by cell body collisions and/or shortrange hydrodynamic interactions.},

The coupling between BZ droplets is dominated by inhibition and is strongest at low concentrations of malonic acid (MA) and small droplet separations. A microfluidic chip is used for mixing the BZ reactants, forming monodisperse droplets by flow-focusing and directing them into a hydrophobized 100 \textmu m diameter capillary. For samples composed of many drops and in the absence of well defined initial conditions, the anti-phase attractor, in which adjacent droplets oscillate 180\textdegree{} out-of-phase, is observed for strong coupling. When the coupling strength is reduced the initial transients in the phase difference between neighboring droplets persist until the BZ reactants are exhausted. In order to make quantitative comparison with theory, we use photosensitive Ru(bipy)32+-catalyzed BZ droplets and set both boundary and initial conditions of arrays of small numbers of oscillating BZ droplets with a programmable illumination source. In these small collections of droplets, transient patterns decay rapidly and we observe several more complex attractors, including ones in which some adjacent droplets are in-phase. Excellent agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is achieved.},

Here, we demonstrate how a multistable metamaterial can harness topological solitons with coupled rotational and translational components and become, itself, a crawling robot. We start by characterizing the topological solitons via experimental measurements and analysis. We then use their rotational component to produce a favorable gradient of friction between the metamaterial and the underlying substrate. This, in turn, creates locomotion. Previously proposed crawling robots usually require complex control of multiple actuators. In contrast, our robot can be powered by a single actuator, and all features needed for locomotion are embedded in the mechanics and activated by the topological solitons.},

  abstract = {Understanding flow and transport of bacteria in porous media is crucial to technologies such as bioremediation, biomineralization or enhanced oil recovery. While physicochemical bacteria filtration is well-documented, recent studies showed that bacterial motility plays a key role in the transport process. Flow and transport experiments performed in microfluidic chips containing randomly placed obstacles confirmed that the distributions of non-motile particles stays compact, whereas for the motile strains, the distributions are characterized by both significant retention as well as fast downstream motion. For motile bacteria, the detailed microscopic study of individual bacteria trajectories reveals two salient features: (i) the emergence of an active retention process triggered by motility, (ii) enhancement of dispersion due to the exchange between fast flow channels and low flow regions in the vicinity of the solid grains. We propose a physical model based on a continuous time random walk approach. This approach accounts for bacteria dispersion via variable pore-scale flow velocities through a Markov model for equidistant particle speeds. Motility of bacteria is modeled by a two-rate trapping process that accounts for the motion towards and active trapping at the obstacles. This approach captures the forward tails observed for the distribution of bacteria displacements, and quantifies an enhanced hydrodynamic dispersion effect that originates in the interaction between flow at the pore-scale and bacterial motility. The model reproduces the experimental observations, and predicts bacteria dispersion and transport at the macroscale.},

  abstract = {Cellular motility is a key function guiding microbial adhesion to interfaces, which is the first step in the formation of biofilms. The close association of biofilms and bioremediation has prompted extensive research aimed at comprehending the physics of microbial locomotion near interfaces. We study the dynamics and statistics of microorganisms in a `floating biofilm', i.e., a confinement with an air\textendash liquid interface on one side and a liquid\textendash liquid interface on the other. We use a very general mathematical model, based on a multipole representation and probabilistic simulations, to ascertain the spatial distribution of microorganisms in films of different viscosities. Our results reveal that microorganisms can be distributed symmetrically or asymmetrically across the height of the film, depending on their morphology and the ratio of the film's viscosity to that of the fluid substrate. Long-flagellated, elongated bacteria exhibit stable swimming parallel to the liquid\textendash liquid interface when the bacterial film is less viscous than the underlying fluid. Bacteria with shorter flagella on the other hand, swim away from the liquid\textendash liquid interface and accumulate at the free surface. We also analyze microorganism dynamics in a flowing film and show how a microorganism's ability to resist `flow-induced-erosion' from interfaces is affected by its elongation and mode of propulsion. Our study generalizes past efforts on understanding microorganism dynamics under confinement by interfaces and provides key insights on biofilm initiation at liquid\textendash liquid interfaces.},

One of the hallmarks of swimming near a surface is a defined curvature of bacterial trajectories, underlining the importance of counter rotations of the cell body and flagellum for locomotion of the microorganism. We find that there is another mode of bacterial motion on solid surfaces, i.e., self trapping due to fluid flows created by a rotating flagellum perpendicular to the surface. For a rod-like bacterium, such as Escherichia coli, this creates a peculiar situation in that the bacterium appears to swim along a minor axis of the cell body and is pressed against the surface. Although a full hydrodynamic theory is still lacking to explain the self-trapping phenomenon, the effect is intriguing and can be exploited to study a variety of biophysical phenomena of swimming bacteria. In particular, we showed that self-trapped E.~coli cells display a chemotaxis response that is identical to the classical rotation assay in which antibodies are used to physically "glue" a flagellum to the surface.},

  abstract = {Treatment of bacterial biofilms remains a great challenge in the clinic. Recently, ultrasound (US)-driven antimicrobial sonodynamic therapy (aSDT) has been considered as an emerging therapeutic strategy for the treatment of biofilm infections. However, the hypoxic microenvironment and restricted diffusion of sonosensitizers within biofilms substantially reduce the therapeutic efficacy of aSDT. Herein, a biofilm microenvironment-responsive nanoplatform was proposed to promote biofilm degradation and sonosensitizer penetration, and relieve the hypoxic microenvironment, thereby augmenting aSDT efficiency against bacterial biofilm infections. This nanoplatform was prepared by modifying manganese dioxide nanosheets (MNS) with {$\alpha$}-amylase, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and chlorin e6 (Ce6) to form MNS-{$\alpha$}-amylase/PEG-Ce6 nanosheets (MAPC). After delivery into biofilm-infected tissues, MAPC decompose in the acidic biofilm microenvironment to locally release {$\alpha$}-amylase and Ce6. The {$\alpha$}-amylase degrades the extracellular polymeric substances of biofilms to promote Ce6 penetration. In addition, the MNS catalyze the conversion of endogenously overproduced H2O2 into O2 in infected tissue and relieve the hypoxic microenvironment to further enhance antibiofilm efficacy of aSDT. Such biofilm degradation and hypoxia-relief enhanced aSDT show approximately 6.9 log units (99.99998\%) reduction of bacteria within biofilms in vitro, and efficiently treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms-infected mice. Overall, biofilm degradation improves sonosensitizer penetration and relieves the hypoxic biofilm microenvironment to enhance the effects of aSDT by MAPC. Thus, the use of this nanoplatform provides a promising strategy for combating bacterial biofilm-associated infections.},

The viscoelastic nonlinearity of the three nanofluids groups was studied by Lissajous curves, local nonlinear viscoelastic moduli of an oscillatory shear cycle, and Fourier transform rheology as a function of filler concentration and increasing and decreasing strain magnitude. The nonlinear behavior of the nanofluids was compared to understand the variation of internal microstructures. Firstly, GO/PDMS composites behave with higher moduli and smaller linear viscoelastic range comparing to that of other two composites. Secondly, the elastic stress Lissajous curves of these composites changed from elliptic to rectangular with round the corner with increasing the filler level and strain amplitude. Thirdly, all these three nanofluids exhibited intra-cycle strain stiffening with increasing strains and shear thickening at intermediate strain and then shearing thinning with increasing strain further. Fourthly, higher harmonic intensity of rGO/PDMS increased with increasing strain and came to a plateau, while that of other two nanofluids reached a maximum and then decreased. It suggested that different surface functionalization of nanoparticles will present different rheological behavior due to formed different network and LAOS could be used as a potential helpful method to characterize rheological properties of nanocomposites, especially at higher shear strain.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms have evolved to thrive in virtually any terrestrial and marine environment, exposing them to various mechanical cues mainly generated by fluid flow and pressure as well as surface contact. Cellular components enable bacteria to sense and respond to physical cues to optimize their function, ultimately improving bacterial fitness. Owing to newly developed biophysical techniques, we are now starting to appreciate the breadth of bacterial phenotypes influenced by mechanical inputs: adhesion, motility{$\mkern1mu$}, biofilm formation and pathogenicity. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss how microbiology and biophysics are converging to advance our understanding of the mechanobiology of microorganisms. We first review the various physical forces that bacteria experience in their natural environments and describe the structures that transmit these forces to a cell. We then discuss how forces can provide feedback to enhance adhesion and motility and how they can be transduced by dedicated cellular machinery to regulate diverse phenotypes. Finally{$\mkern1mu$}, we provide a perspective on how mechanics influence biofilm spatial organization and homeostasis.},

Here, we study both analytically and numerically the scattering of a tracer particle in different types of time-dependent, hydrodynamic flow fields. Specifically, we compare the tracer motion induced by an externally driven colloid with the one generated by various self-motile, multi-sphere swimmers. Our results suggest that force-free swimmers generically induce loop-shaped tracer trajectories. The specific topological structure of these loops is determined by the hydrodynamic properties of the microswimmer. Quantitative estimates for typical experimental conditions imply that the loops survive on average even if Brownian motion effects are taken into account.},

Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift\textendash Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner\textendash Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitative description of dense bacterial suspensions. We discuss how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces, and conclude by outlining future applications.},

Applying this pipeline to gnotobiotic and human microbiota-colonized mice, we demonstrate that elimination of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) from the diet results in thinner mucus in the distal colon, increased proximity of microbes to the epithelium, and heightened expression of the inflammatory marker REG3b. Measurements of microbe-microbe proximity reveal that a MACdeficient diet alters monophyletic spatial clustering. Furthermore, we quantify the invasion of Helicobacter pylori into the glands of the mouse stomach relative to host mitotic progenitor cells, illustrating the generalizability of this approach.},

Our focus will be mostly on surface tension effects, which result from the cohesive properties of liquids. Paradoxically, cohesive forces promote the breakup of jets, widely encountered in nature, technology and basic science, for example in nuclear fission, DNA sampling, medical diagnostics, sprays, agricultural irrigation and jet engine technology. Liquid jets thus serve as a paradigm for free-surface motion, hydrodynamic instability and singularity formation leading to drop breakup. In addition to their practical usefulness, jets are an ideal probe for liquid properties, such as surface tension, viscosity or non-Newtonian rheology. They also arise from the last but one topology change of liquid masses bursting into sprays. Jet dynamics are sensitive to the turbulent or thermal excitation of the fluid, as well as to the surrounding gas or fluid medium. The aim of this review is to provide a unified description of the fundamental and the technological aspects of these subjects.},

  abstract = {Locomotion and transport of microorganisms in fluids is an essential aspect of life. Search for food, orientation toward light, spreading of off-spring, and the formation of colonies are only possible due to locomotion. Swimming at the microscale occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where fluid friction and viscosity dominates over inertia. Here, evolution achieved propulsion mechanisms, which overcome and even exploit drag. Prominent propulsion mechanisms are rotating helical flagella, exploited by many bacteria, and snake-like or whip-like motion of eukaryotic flagella, utilized by sperm and algae. For artificial microswimmers, alternative concepts to convert chemical energy or heat into directed motion can be employed, which are potentially more efficient. The dynamics of microswimmers comprises many facets, which are all required to achieve locomotion. In this article, we review the physics of locomotion of biological and synthetic microswimmers, and the collective behavior of their assemblies. Starting from individual microswimmers, we describe the various propulsion mechanism of biological and synthetic systems and address the hydrodynamic aspects of swimming. This comprises synchronization and the concerted beating of flagella and cilia. In addition, the swimming behavior next to surfaces is examined. Finally, collective and cooperate phenomena of various types of isotropic and anisotropic swimmers with and without hydrodynamic interactions are discussed.},

In the presence of force-generating active materials, these defects are able to migrate through space like swimming microorganisms. We use toroidal surfaces to show that despite their highly chaotic and non-equilibrium dynamics, pairs of defects unbind and segregate in regions of opposite Gaussian curvature. Using numerical simulations, we find that the degree of defect unbinding can be controlled by tuning the system activity, and even suppressed in strongly active systems. Furthermore, by using the defects as active microrheological tracers and quantitatively comparing our experimental and theoretical results, we are able to determine material properties of the active nematic. Our results illustrate how topology and geometry can be used to control the behaviour of active materials, and introduce a new avenue for the quantitative mechanical characterization of active fluids.},

  abstract = {When confined to curved surfaces or to bounded volumes, ordered materials often experience geometric frustration, where the order cannot be satisfied everywhere on the surface or in the volume. This frustration induces unavoidable distortions in the material, possibly resulting in the generation of one or more defects in the order. In this thesis, we focus on materials with nematic order and investigate the role of geometry in the interplay between order and confinement. We first consider a nematic confined to the surface of a toroidal droplet. The nematic is active such that the individual particles do work on their surroundings. This activity results in a nematic that spontaneously undergoes creation and annihilation of opposite-signed pairs of topological defects; these defects continually move and explore the surface of the torus. Despite the activity, we find that the defects couple to the underlying curvature of the surface: on average, the positive defects migrate towards the outside of the torus, where the Gaussian curvature is positive, and the negative defects migrate towards the inside of the torus, where Gaussian curvature is negative. When we compare our results to equilibrium predictions as well as to computer simulations of our active nematic, we find that adding activity to order resembles bringing an equilibrium system to high temperature; that is, activity plays the role of thermal fluctuations in driving the defects to explore configuration space. There are, however, significant differences with equilibrium nematics that bring richness to the problem. We next consider a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) confined to toroidal droplets with homeotropic anchoring. We find a twisted equilibrium configuration, where the nematic spontaneously develops chirality and the amount of twist depends on the ratio of the torus ring and tube radii. Experiments with a NLC confined to straight and bent cylindrical capillaries under similar conditions reveal that the twist is a response to the additional curvature that arises when bending a cylinder into a torus. Lastly, we consider a NLC confined to a capillary bridge under homeotropic anchoring such that the topology requires the presence of a defect in the bulk. We perform experiments with waist-shaped and barrel-shaped bridges and find that waist-shaped bridges contain hyperbolic defects while barrel-shaped bridges contain radial defects. In addition, we find that the ratio of the bridge height to its width determines whether the defect is a ring defect or a point defect. Overall, our results illustrate the variety of ways curvature affects nematic order: it can control defect type, defect location, and can even tune specific distortions in the order.},

  abstract = {The exact solution for a small falling drop is a classical result by Hadamard and Rybczynski. But experiments show that small drops fall slower than predicted, giving closer agreement with Stokes' result for a falling hard sphere. Increasing the drop size, a transition between these two extremes is found. This is due to surfactants present in the system, and previous work has led to the stagnant-cap model. We present here an alternative approach which we call the continuous-interface model. In contrast to the stagnant-cap model, we do not consider a surfactant advection\textendash diffusionequation at the interface. Taking instead the normal and tangential interfacial stresses into account, we solve the Stokes equation analytically for the falling drop with varying interfacial tension. Some of the solutions thus obtained, e.g. the hovering drop, violate conservation of energy unless energy is provided directly to the interface. Considering the energy budget of the drop, we show that the terminal velocity is bounded by the Stokes and the Hadamard\textendash Rybczynski results. The continuous-interface model is then obtained from the force balance for surfactants at the interface. The resulting expressions gives the transition between the two extremes, and also predicts that the critical radius, below which drops fall like hard spheres, is proportional to the interfacial surfactant concentration. By analysing experimental results from the literature, we confirm this prediction, thus providing strong arguments for the validity of the proposed model.},

We studied two model biofluids, blood plasma and synovial fluid, when deposited onto slightly hydrophilic substrates forming a contact angle of 50\textendash 90\textdegree. Drops were imaged during the evaporation process and geometric properties of the drop, such as contact angle and drop height, were calculated from the images. The resulting dried biofluid drops were then examined using light microscopy and Raman spectroscopy to assess morphological and chemical composition of the dried drop. The effect of substrate contact angle (surface wetting) and fluid concentration was examined. We found that when biofluids are deposited onto slightly hydrophilic surfaces, with a contact angle of 50\textendash 90\textdegree, a ring-shaped deposit was formed. Analysis of the drying drop's geometric properties indicates that biofluid dynamics follow the piling model of drop formation, as proposed by Deegan               et al.               The final deposition pattern varied with substrate surface and concentration, as shown by light microscopy photos of dried drops. The chemical composition of the outer ring was minimally affected by substrate surface, but the spatial heterogeneity of protein distribution within the ring varied with concentration. These results indicate that biofluid drop deposition produces ring-shaped deposits which can be examined by multiple analytical techniques.},

  abstract = {Confined suspensions of active particles show peculiar dynamics characterized by wall accumulation, as well as upstream swimming, centreline depletion and shear trapping when a pressure-driven flow is imposed. We use theory and numerical simulations to investigate the effects of confinement and non-uniform shear on the dynamics of a dilute suspension of Brownian active swimmers by incorporating a detailed treatment of boundary conditions within a simple kinetic model where the configuration of the suspension is described using a conservation equation for the probability distribution function of particle positions and orientations, and where particle\textendash particle and particle\textendash wall hydrodynamic interactions are neglected. Based on this model, we first investigate the effects of confinement in the absence of flow, in which case the dynamics is governed by a swimming P\'eclet number, or ratio of the persistence length of particle trajectories over the channel width, and a second swimmer-specific parameter whose inverse measures the strength of propulsion. In the limit of weak and strong propulsion, asymptotic expressions for the full distribution function are derived. For finite propulsion, analytical expressions for the concentration and polarization profiles are also obtained using a truncated moment expansion of the distribution function. In agreement with experimental observations, the existence of a concentration/polarization boundary layer in wide channels is reported and characterized, suggesting that wall accumulation in active suspensions is primarily a kinematic effect that does not require hydrodynamic interactions. Next, we show that application of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow leads to net upstream swimming of the particles relative to the flow, and an analytical expression for the mean upstream velocity is derived in the weak-flow limit. In stronger imposed flows, we also predict the formation of a depletion layer near the channel centreline, due to cross-streamline migration of the swimming particles towards high-shear regions where they become trapped, and an asymptotic analysis in the strong-flow limit is used to obtain a scale for the depletion layer thickness and to rationalize the non-monotonic dependence of the intensity of depletion upon flow rate. Our theoretical predictions are all shown to be in excellent agreement with finite-volume numerical simulations of the kinetic model, and are also supported by recent experiments on bacterial suspensions in microfluidic devices.},

Conversely, the theory may be used to construct the box shape that yields any desired density distribution on the boundary, thus offering a general tool to understand and design such confinements. When the curvature variations are small, we also predict the distribution of orientations at the boundary and the exponential decay of pressure as a function of box size recently observed in simulations in a spherical box.},

EPS are dynamic in space and time and their components interact in complex ways, fulfilling various functions: to stabilize the matrix, acquire nutrients, retain and protect eDNA or exoenzymes, or offer sorption sites for ions and hydrophobic substances. The retention of exoenzymes effectively renders the biofilm matrix an external digestion system influencing the global turnover of biopolymers, considering the ubiquitous relevance of biofilms. Physico-chemical and biological interactions and environmental conditions enable biofilm systems to morph into films, microcolonies and macrocolonies, films, ridges, ripples, columns, pellicles, bubbles, mushrooms and suspended aggregates \textemdash{} in response to the very diverse conditions confronting a particular biofilm community. Assembly and dynamics of the matrix are mostly coordinated by secondary messengers, signalling molecules or small RNAs, in both medically relevant and environmental biofilms.

  abstract = {Active systems evade the rules of equilibrium thermodynamics by constantly dissipating energy at the level of their microscopic components. This energy flux stems from the conversion of a fuel, present in the environment, into sustained individual motion. It can lead to collective effects without any equilibrium equivalent, such as a phase separation for purely repulsive particles, or a collective motion (flocking) for aligning particles. Some of these effects can be rationalized by using equilibrium tools to recapitulate nonequilibrium transitions. An important challenge is then to delineate systematically to which extent the character of these active transitions is genuinely distinct from equilibrium analogs. We review recent works that use stochastic thermodynamics tools to identify, for active systems, a measure of irreversibility comprising a coarse-grained or informatic entropy production. We describe how this relates to the underlying energy dissipation or thermodynamic entropy production, and how it is influenced by collective behavior. Then, we review the possibility to construct thermodynamic ensembles out-of-equilibrium, where trajectories are biased towards atypical values of nonequilibrium observables. We show that this is a generic route to discovering unexpected phase transitions in active matter systems, which can also inform their design.},

However, the studied samples contained about 700 new species, most of which (about 500) have not yet been described. Thus, the total number of soil ciliates amounts to at least 1000 species. The overwhelming portion of soil ciliates belongs to three systematic assemblages, viz. the hypotrichs (39\%), gymnostomatids (26\%) and colpodids (13\%) if the undescribed species are taken into account. Most soil ciliates feed on bacteria (39\%) or are predatory (34\%) or omnivorous (20\%). Some are strictly mycophagous and highly characteristic for terrestrial habitats; and a few (mainly metopids) are anaerobic. Only about one fourth of the soil ciliate species has been reliably reported from freshwater habitats and from more than three out of five main biogeographical regions, indicating a high specificity of the soil ciliate biota and a limited distribution of at least some species. This is supported by the observation that some very conspicuous species, such as Krassniggia auxiliaris and Bresslauides discoideus, have so far been found only in Gondwanan, respectively, Laurasian soils.},

Here, we introduce and explore an analytically tractable nonlinear model for compressible active flow networks. In contrast to thermally driven systems, we find that active friction selects discrete states with a limited number of oscillation modes activated at distinct fixed amplitudes. Using perturbation theory, we systematically predict the stationary states of noisy networks and find good agreement with a Bayesian state estimation based on a hidden Markov model applied to simulated time series data. Our results suggest that the macroscopic response of active network structures, from actomyosin force networks to cytoplasmic flows, can be dominated by a significantly reduced number of modes, in contrast to energy equipartition in thermal equilibrium. The model is also well suited to study topological sound modes and spectral band gaps in active matter.},

Moreover cell motility is also intrinsically noisy due to spontaneous random reorientations and speed fluctuations. This interplay of internal and external noise sources gives rise to a complex dynamical behavior that can be strongly sensitive to details and hard to model quantitatively. In striking contrast to this general picture we show that the mean residence time of swimming bacteria inside artificial complex microstructures is quantitatively predicted by a generic invariance property of random walks. We find that while external shape and internal disorder have dramatic effects on the distributions of path lengths and residence times, the corresponding mean values are constrained by the sole free surface to perimeter ratio. As a counterintuitive consequence, bacteria escape faster from structures with higher density of obstacles due to the lower accessible surface.},

  abstract = {Out of equilibrium, a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception. Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1\textendash 6, non-equilibrium systems7\textendash 9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13\textendash 15 and metamaterials16\textendash 20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16\textendash 20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle.},

  abstract = {Microbial biofilms have caused serious concerns in healthcare, medical, and food industries because of their intrinsic resistance against conventional antibiotics and cleaning procedures and their capability to firmly adhere on surfaces for persistent contamination. These global issues strongly motivate researchers to develop novel methodologies to investigate the kinetics underlying biofilm formation, to understand the response of the biofilm with different chemical and physical treatments, and to identify biofilm-specific drugs with high-throughput screenings. Meanwhile microbial biofilms can also be utilized positively as sensing elements in cell-based sensors due to their strong adhesion on surfaces. In this perspective, we provide an overview on the connections between sensing and microbial biofilms, focusing on tools used to investigate biofilm properties, kinetics, and their response to chemicals or physical agents, and biofilm-based sensors, a type of biosensor using the bacterial biofilm as a biorecognition element to capture the presence of the target of interest by measuring the metabolic activity of the immobilized microbial cells. Finally we discuss possible new research directions for the development of robust and rapid biofilm related sensors with high temporal and spatial resolutions, pertinent to a wide range of applications.},

Their anomalous physical properties could be applied in areas such as mixing or separation, micropumps, and self-healing materials. To realize such applications, a thorough understanding of the physical mechanisms as well as the development of methods to manipulate various active systems is required. Using a coarse-grained active liquid crystal model, we designed and investigated a single self-driven droplet which encapsulated a dense suspension comprising nonmotile but mobile active particles that generate extensile stresses. We showed that such droplets can be driven into motion and can have tunable mobilities owing to their internal collective motion, which is characterized by induced active flows and motile disclination defects. Furthermore, it was illustrated that the interplay among the internal directional flows, liquid crystalline structures, droplet size, and surface tension resulted in different types of locomotion and rotation.},

  abstract = {Wetting of solid surfaces occurs when the intervening air film between a water droplet and a solid surface ruptures. Although this rupturing phenomenon is well known, the underlying mechanism has not yet been well understood. In this work, the rupture of intervening air films is systematically studied by measuring the spatiotemporal thickness profiles of the air films between droplets of deionized water and flat solid surfaces using a synchronized triwavelength reflection interferometry microscope. It has been shown that the critical rupture thickness of the air film (hc) depends on the surface hydrophobicity of solid surfaces. The hc value was increased from 50 nm on a hydrophobic surface having an equilibrium water contact angle (\texttheta w) of 96\textdegree{} to 1.42 {$\mu$}m on a hydrophilic surface having a \texttheta w of 25\textdegree. In addition, an increase in the critical rupture thickness with decreasing surface hydrophobicity was found to be applicable not only to chemically treated quartz surfaces but also to a variety of natural mineral surfaces. By determining the pressure within the air films, we have shown that a strong attractive force is present between water droplets and hydrophilic surfaces, thereby accelerating the draining of air films. The measured forces might be of electrostatic origin, and the forces become less attractive with increasing hydrophobicity of solid surfaces. The present result provides a fundamental insight into the rupture of air films from the perspective of surface forces.},

We investigate the collective behaviour of nematodes in a thin liquid layer, which was first described by Gray and Lissmann [J. Exp. Biol., 1964, 41, 135]. We show experimentally that nematodes confined by a thin liquid film come into contact spontaneously. By analysing the time scales of this aggregation, we suggest that the initial aggregation is driven by random collisions between nematodes but the continued collective motion is due to an attractive force between them arising from the surface tension of the layer. We show that for nearby nematodes this surface tension force is typically stronger than the force that may be exerted by the nematodes' muscles. We believe this to be the first demonstration of the ``Cheerios effect'' acting on a living organism. However, we find that being grouped together does not significantly alter the body stroke and kinematic performance of the nematode: there are no statistically significant changes of the Strouhal number and the ratio of amplitude to wavelength when aggregated. This result implies that nematodes gain neither a mechanical advantage nor disadvantage by being grouped together; the capillary force merely keeps them stuck together after a chance encounter.},

However, the dynamic response of a damaged leaf to a raindrop impact has not been investigated and could clarify the direct influence of changes in wettability on early leaf abscission. In this article, we investigate how leaves with different surface properties respond to falling raindrops, viewing this as a unique system of coupled elasticity and drop dynamics. An elastic beam with tunable surface wettability properties is used as a simple leaf model. We find that wettable beams experience much higher torque and bending energy than nonwettable beams. This is because a drop sticks to a wettable beam, while a drop falls off a nonwettable beam. An analytical model using momentum balance and simple cantilever beam theory quantifies the bending energy and torque experienced by wettable and nonwettable beams. The results elucidate the potential damage caused by raindrops impacting a leaf as a function of its surface wettability and are correlated with environmental factors contributing to premature changes of leaf surface properties.},

We observed the drinking behavior of a wide range of dogs across breeds and body size, and used physical experiments to mimic the motion of a dog's tongue as it exits the water. Dogs accelerate the tongue upward more quickly than do cats, and then time their bite to coincide with the pinch-off of the column. The everyday experience of dogs as messy drinkers results from the backward curl of the tongue, which increases the size of the water column and thus enables dogs to drink more per lap than with a straight tongue.           ,              Dogs lap because they have incomplete cheeks and cannot suck. When lapping, a dog's tongue pulls a liquid column from the bath, suggesting that the hydrodynamics of column formation are critical to understanding how dogs drink. We measured lapping in 19 dogs and used the results to generate a physical model of the tongue's interaction with the air\textendash fluid interface. These experiments help to explain how dogs exploit the fluid dynamics of the generated column. The results demonstrate that effects of acceleration govern lapping frequency, which suggests that dogs curl the tongue to create a larger liquid column. Comparing lapping in dogs and cats reveals that, despite similar morphology, these carnivores lap in different physical regimes: an unsteady inertial regime for dogs and steady inertial regime for cats.},

  abstract = {The drying of complex fluids involves a large number of microscopic phenomena (transport and organization of non-volatile solutes) as well as hydrodynamic and mechanical instabilities. These phenomena can be captured in drying sessile drops where different domains can be identified: strong concentration gradients, formation of a glassy or porous envelope that withstands mechanical stress, and consolidation of a layer strongly adhering to the substrate at the drop edge. In colloidal systems, we quantify the evolution of the particle volume fraction at a nanometric scale and microscopic scale and identify the conditions for the envelope formation at the free surface by balancing the effect of diffusion and evaporation. When a solid envelope is formed at a drop surface, the mechanical instabilities induced by the drying result in different drop shapes. Finally, large drying stresses build up in the solid layer adhering on the substrate, and possibly cause crack formation. In particular, we study how crack patterns are affected by the contact angle of drops and the drying conditions. A particular interest of the review is devoted to drying pattern of solutes.},

Specifically, we simulate light-controlled surface-driven active matter, probing the emergent properties of a suspension of active colloids that can bind and unbind from surfaces of a closed microchamber, together creating an active carpet. The attached colloids generate large-scale flows that in turn can advect detached particles toward the walls. Switching the particle velocities with light, we program the active suspension and demonstrate a rich design space of flow patterns characterized by topological defects. We derive the possible mode structures and use this theory to optimize different microfluidic functions including hydrodynamic compartmentalization and chaotic mixing. Our results pave the way toward designing and controlling surface-driven active fluids.},

  abstract = {In many situations, bacteria move in complex environments, as soils, oceans or the human gut-track, where carrier fluids show complex structures associated with non-Newtonian rheology. Many fundamental questions concerning the ability to navigate in such environments remain unsolved. Recently, it has been shown that the kinetics of bacterial motion in structured fluids as liquid crystals (LCs) is constrained by the orientational molecular order (or director field) and that novel spatio-temporal patterns arise. A question unaddressed so far is how bacteria change swimming direction in such an environment. In this work, we study the swimming mechanism of a single bacterium, Esherichia coli, constrained to move along the director field of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal confined to a planar cell. Here, the spontaneous `run and tumble' motion of the bacterium gets frustrated: the elasticity of the LC prevents flagella from unbundling. Interestingly, to change direction, bacteria execute a reversal motion along the director field, driven by the relocation of a single flagellum, a `frustrated tumble'. We characterize this phenomenon in detail experimentally, exploiting exceptional spatial and temporal resolution of bacterial and flagellar dynamics, using a two colour Lagrangian tracking technique. We suggest a possible mechanism accounting for these observations.},

In contrast to previous studies, we find that the damping and noise correlations possess long-time tails with exponents that depend on the tracer symmetry. For generic tracers, shape asymmetry induces ratchet effects that alter fluctuations and lead to superdiffusion and friction that grows with time when the tracer is dragged at a constant speed. In the singular limit of a completely symmetric tracer, we recover normal diffusion and finite friction. Furthermore, for small symmetric tracers, the active contribution to the friction becomes negative: active particles enhance motion rather than oppose it. These results show that, in low-dimensional systems, the motion of a passive tracer in an active bath cannot be modeled as a persistent random walker with a finite correlation time.},

Instead of increasing the viscosity of the suspending fluid, the emergent collective motions of swimming bacteria can turn a suspension into a superfluid with zero apparent viscosity. Although the existence of active superfluids has been demonstrated in bulk rheological measurements, the microscopic origin and dynamics of such an exotic phase have not been experimentally probed. Here, using high-speed confocal rheometry, we study the dynamics of concentrated bacterial suspensions under simple planar shear. We find that bacterial superfluids under shear exhibit unusual symmetric shear bands, defying the conventional wisdom on shear banding of complex fluids, where the formation of steady shear bands necessarily breaks the symmetry of unsheared samples. We propose a simple hydrodynamic model based on the local stress balance and the ergodic sampling of nonequilibrium shear configurations, which quantitatively describes the observed symmetric shear-banding structure. The model also successfully predicts various interesting features of swarming vortices in stationary bacterial suspensions. Our study provides insights into the physical properties of collective swarming in active fluids and illustrates their profound influences on transport processes.},

Here, we survey the notion of thermodynamic temperature in different statistical ensembles, focusing in particular on subtleties that arise when ensembles become non-equivalent. The `mother' of all ensembles, the microcanonical ensemble, uses entropy and internal energy (the most fundamental, dynamically conserved quantity) to derive temperature as a secondary thermodynamic variable. Over the past century, some confusion has been caused by the fact that several competing microcanonical entropy definitions are used in the literature, most commonly the volume and surface entropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be proved, however, that only the volume entropy satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of thermodynamics for a broad class of physical systems, including all standard classical Hamiltonian systems, regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous fact implies that negative `absolute' temperatures and Carnot efficiencies more than 1 are not achievable within a standard thermodynamical framework. As an important offspring of microcanonical thermostatistics, we shall briefly consider the canonical ensemble and comment on the validity of the Boltzmann weight factor. We conclude by addressing open mathematical problems that arise for systems with discrete energy spectra.},

The average distance between defects, also called active length scale, depends on the competition between these forces. Here, in experiments with the microtubule/kinesin active nematic system, we show that the intrinsic active length scale loses its relevance under strong lateral confinement. Transitions are observed from chaotic to vortex lattices and defect-free unidirectional flows. Defects, which determine the active flow behaviour, are created and annihilated on the channel walls rather than in the bulk, and acquire a strong orientational order in narrow channels. Their nucleation is governed by an instability whose wavelength is effectively screened by the channel width. These results are recovered in simulations, and the comparison highlights the role of boundary conditions.},

Controlling the flow patterns of active nematics remains a limiting step towards their use as functional materials. Here we show that confining a tubulin\textendash kinesin active nematic to a network of connected annular microfluidic channels enables controlled directional flows and autonomous transport. In single annular channels, for narrow widths, the typically chaotic streams transform into well-defined circulating flows, whose direction or handedness can be controlled by introducing asymmetric corrugations on the channel walls. The dynamics is altered when two or three annular channels are interconnected. These more complex topologies lead to scenarios of synchronization, anti-correlation, and frustration of the active flows, and to the stabilisation of high topological singularities in both the flow field and the orientational field of the material. Controlling textures and flows in these microfluidic platforms opens unexplored perspectives towards their application in biotechnology and materials science.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the role of the topology of the environment on the formation of complex nematic fields and defect structures, specifically in the system of nematic colloidal knots. The topological environments around knotted colloidal particles are suggested to exist as spherical surface-patterned nematic cavities imposing radial, uniform or hyperbolic nematic profiles. We show that topologically different nematic environments significantly affect and create differences in the colloidal field structure created within the environment, such as the location, profile and number of topological defects. Specifically, we demonstrate that topological environments in combination with knotted colloidal particles of non-trivial topology lead to the formation of diverse nematic knotted and linked fields. These fields are different adaptations of the knotted shape of the colloidal particles, creating knots and links of topological defects as well as escaped-core defect-like solitonic structures. These are observed in chiral nematic media but here are stabilised in achiral nematic media as a result of the distinct shape of the knotted colloidal particle, with a double helix segment and nematic environmental patterns. More generally, this paper is a contribution towards understanding the role of environment, especially its topology, on the response and defect formation in elastic fields, such as in nematic liquid crystal colloids.},

Collective length-scale selection has been observed in bacterial fluids, endothelial tissue, and active colloids, yet the physical origins of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we systematically derive an effective fourth-order field theory from a generic microscopic model that allows us to predict the typical vortex size in microswimmer suspensions. Building on a self-consistent closure condition, the derivation shows that the vortex length scale is determined by the competition between local alignment forces, rotational diffusion, and intermediate-range hydrodynamic interactions. Vortex structures found in simulations of the theory agree with recent measurements in Bacillus subtilis suspensions. Moreover, our approach yields an effective viscosity enhancement (reduction), as reported experimentally for puller (pusher) microorganisms.},

Bacteria, which can be found in a variety of environments, have developed among the richest set of locomotion mechanisms both at the microscopic and collective levels. Here, we uncover, experimentally, a mode of collective bacterial motility in humid environment through the depinning of bacterial droplets. Although capillary forces are notoriously enormous at the bacterial scale, even capable of pinning water droplets of millimetric size on inclined surfaces, we show that bacteria are able to harness a variety of mechanisms to unpin contact lines, hence inducing a collective slipping of the colony across the surface. Contrary to flagella-dependent migration modes like swarming, we show that this much faster ``colony surfing'' still occurs in mutant strains of               Bacillus subtilis               lacking flagella. The active unpinning seen in our experiments relies on a variety of microscopic mechanisms, which could each play an important role in the migration of microorganisms in humid environment.},

The results of simulations are compared with a theory that describes dilute suspensions of swimmers. The theory yields scalings with concentration for diffusivities and velocity fluctuations as well as a prediction of the fluid velocity spatial autocorrelation function. Even for uncorrelated swimmers, the theory predicts anticorrelations between nearby fluid elements that correspond to vortex-like swirling motions in the fluid with length scale set by the size of a swimmer and the slit height. Very similar results arise from the full simulations indicating either that correlated motion of the swimmers is not significant at the concentrations considered or that the fluid phase autocorrelation is not a sensitive measure of the correlated motion. This result is in stark contrast with results from unconfined systems, for which the fluid autocorrelation captures large-scale collective fluid structures. The additional length scale (screening length) introduced by the confinement seems to prevent these large-scale structures from forming.},

  abstract = {The formation of bacterial biofilms on solid surfaces within a fluid starts when bacteria attach to the substrate. Understanding environmental factors affecting the attachment and the early stages of the biofilm development as well as the development of active methods of biofilm control are crucial for many applications. Here we show that biofilm formation is strongly affected by the hydrodynamics of flows generated by surface waves in layers of bacterial suspensions. Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned biofilms while wave-driven turbulent motion destroys the patterns. The location of the attached bacteria on a solid substrate differs from the settlement location of inactive bacteria and of the passive micro-particles: strong biofilms form under the wave antinodes while passive particles and inactive bacteria settle under nodal points. By controlling the wave lengths and horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can either shape the biofilm formation and enhance the biofilm growth, or discourage the formation of biofilm patterns. The results suggest that the deterministic wave-driven transport, rather than hydrodynamic forces, determine the preferred location for the bacterial attachment.},

Despite the absence of surface tension to stabilize short-wavelength undulations, we observe finite-size fingers that grow and pinch off from the drop. We show that the fingering patterns formed in the experiments resultes from a balance between the outward buoyancy effect and inward Marangoni flow. This induced Marangoni flow inhibits small perturbations and acts as an effective surface tension on the miscible interface of the spreading drop. To characterize the final size and shape of the drop, we perform systematic experiments by varying the drop volume and the glycerol-water volume fraction. In addition, we have developed scaling arguments for the drop's final radius using key physical forces, and show that the final wavelength is inversely proportional to the Bond number.},

Thereby, the orientation (clockwise, counterclockwise) and the curvature depend on the surface properties. We employ mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations of a mechano-elastic model of E. coli, with a spherocylindrical body propelled by a bundle of rotating helical flagella, to study quantitatively the curvature of the appearing circular trajectories. We demonstrate that the cell is sensitive to nanoscale changes in the surface slip length. The results are employed to propose a novel approach to directing bacterial motion on striped surfaces with different slip lengths, which implies a transformation of the circular motion into a snaking motion along the stripe boundaries. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by a simulation of active Brownian rods, which also reveals a dependence of directional motion on the stripe width.},

With a confined boundary, active fluids can generate bulk flow inside the system, which has the potential to create self-propelled active matter. In this study, we propose that an active droplet is driven by a collective motion of enclosed microswimmers. We show that the droplet migrates via the flow field generated by the enclosed microswimmers; moreover, the locomotion direction depends on the swimming mode of these internal particles. The locomotion mechanism of the droplet can be well explained by interfacial velocity, and the locomotion velocity shows good agreement with the Lighthill-Blake theory. These findings are essential to understand the interplay between the motion of self-propelled particles and the bulk motion response of active matter.},

The mechanisms that govern the transmission of mechanical forces in epithelia and the collective response of the tissue to bulk shear deformations remain, however, poorly understood. Using a minimal cell-based computational model, we investigate the constitutive relation of confluent tissues under simple shear deformation. We show that an initially undeformed fluidlike tissue acquires finite rigidity above a critical applied strain. This is akin to the shear-driven rigidity observed in other soft matter systems. Interestingly, shear-driven rigidity can be understood by a critical scaling analysis in the vicinity of the second order critical point that governs the liquid-solid transition of the undeformed system. We further show that a solidlike tissue responds linearly only to small strains and but then switches to a nonlinear response at larger stains, with substantial stiffening. Finally, we propose a mean-field formulation for cells under shear that offers a simple physical explanation of shear-driven rigidity and nonlinear response in a tissue.},

This study investigates the motion of liquid-gas interfaces within cuttlebone-inspired artificial channels. The cuttlebone's unique microstructure, characterized by chambers divided by vertical pillars, exhibits interesting fluid dynamics at small scales while pumping water in and out. Various channels were fabricated with distinct geometries, mimicking cuttlebone features, and subjected to different pressure drops. The behavior of the liquid-gas interface was explored, revealing that channels with pronounced waviness facilitated more non-uniform air-water interfaces. Here, Lyapunov exponents were employed to characterize interface separation, and they indicated more differential motions with increased pressure drops. Channels with greater waviness and amplitude exhibited higher Lyapunov exponents, while straighter channels exhibited slower separation. This is potentially aligned with cuttlefish's natural adaptation to efficient water transport near the membrane, where more straight channels are observed in real cuttlebone.},

  abstract = {Many motile bacteria display wiggling trajectories, which correspond to helical swimming paths. Wiggling trajectories result from flagella pushing off-axis relative to the cell body and making the cell wobble. The spatial extent of wiggling trajectories is controlled by the swimming velocity and flagellar torque, which leads to rotation of the cell body. We employ the method of regularized stokeslets to investigate the wiggling trajectories produced by flagellar bundles, which can form at many locations and orientations relative to the cell body for peritrichously flagellated bacteria. Modelling the bundle as a rigid helix with fixed position and orientation relative to the cell body, we show that the wiggling trajectory depends on the position and orientation of the flagellar bundle relative to the cell body. We observe and quantify the helical wiggling trajectories of Bacillus subtilis, which show a wide range of trajectory pitches and radii, many with pitch larger than 4~. For this bacterium, we show that flagellar bundles with fixed orientation relative to the cell body are unlikely to produce wiggling trajectories with pitch larger than 4~. An estimate based on torque balance shows that this constraint on pitch is a result of the large torque exerted by the flagellar bundle. On the other hand, multiple rigid bundles with fixed orientation, similar to those recently observed experimentally, are able to produce wiggling trajectories with large pitches.},

The unique multi-scale architecture of wheat awns, coupled with condensation and evaporation of dew droplets, facilitated the transport and agglomeration of spores of the fungus. First, dew droplets spontaneously transported spores from the tips of awn hairs to the neighbouring stomatal ridges, driven by gradients in Laplace pressure and surface wettability. Subsequently, spores agglomerated into dry clusters due to the Cheerios effect and evaporation, increasing the likelihood of passive spore removal via wind shear and/or rainsplash. Future plant breeding approaches should consider the development of modified spike structures, such as those without awns or awn hairs, to reduce the potential for spread of fungal plant pathogens.},

  abstract = {The rheological properties of a cell suspension may play an important role in the flow field generated by populations of swimming micro-organisms (e.g. in bioconvection). In this paper, a swimming micro-organism is modelled as a squirming sphere with prescribed tangential surface velocity, in which the centre of mass of the sphere may be displaced from the geometric centre (               bottom-heaviness               ). Effects of inertia and Brownian motion are neglected, because real micro-organisms swim at very low Reynolds numbers but are too large for Brownian effects to be important. The three-dimensional movement of 64 identical squirmers in a simple shear flow field, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions, is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations. The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that has been constructed by the boundary element method. The restriction to pairwise additivity of forces is expected to be justified if the suspension is semi-dilute. The results for non-bottom-heavy squirmers show that the squirming does not have a direct influence on the apparent viscosity. However, it does change the probability density in configuration space, and thereby causes a slight decrease in the apparent viscosity at               O               (               c               2               ), where               c               is the volume fraction of spheres. In the case of bottom-heavy squirmers, on the other hand, the stresslet generated by the squirming motion directly contributes to the bulk stress at               O               (               c               ), and the suspension shows strong non-Newtonian properties. When the background simple shear flow is directed vertically, the apparent viscosity of the semi-dilute suspension of bottom-heavy squirmers becomes smaller than that of inert spheres. When the shear flow is horizontal and varies with the vertical coordinate, on the other hand, the apparent viscosity becomes larger than that of inert spheres. In addition, significant normal stress differences appear for all relative orientations of gravity and the shear flow, in the case of bottom-heavy squirmers.},

  abstract = {We characterize the motility of athermal swimming droplets within the framework of a persistent random walk. Just like active colloids, their trajectories can be modeled with a constant velocity V and a slow angular diffusion, but the random changes in direction are not thermally driven. Instead, V is determined by the interfacial tension gradient along the droplet surface, while reorientation of the surfactant gradient leads to changes in direction with a persistence time {$\tau$}. We show that the origin of locomotion is the difference in the critical micellar concentration in the front and the back of the droplet, {$\Delta$}CMC. Tuning this parameter by salt controls V from 3 to 15 diameters d/s. Surfactant concentration has little effect on speed, but leads to a dramatic decrease in {$\tau$} over 4 orders of magnitude. The corresponding range of the persistence length {$\mathscr{l}$}=V{$\tau$} extends beyond the realm of synthetic or living swimmers, in which V is limited by fuel consumption and {$\tau$} is set by thermal fluctuations or biological activity, respectively. Our tunable swimmers are ideal candidates for the study of the departure from equilibrium to high levels of activity. We show that their collective behavior exhibits the formation of active clusters of a well-defined size.},

Monotherapy with CD47 blockade is ineffective in human clinical trials against many tumor types tested to date, except for rare cutaneous and peripheral lymphomas. In contrast, pre-clinical results show efficacy in multiple syngeneic mouse models of cancer, suggesting that many of these tumor models are more immunogenic and likely artificial compared to human tumors. However, combination therapies in humans of anti-CD47 with agents such as the anti-tumor antibody rituximab do show efficacy against liquid tumors (lymphoma) and are promising. Here, we review such trials as well as key interaction and structural features of CD47-SIRP{$\alpha$}.},

We study the different patterns of ciliary locomotion in glass capillaries of varying diameter and characterize the effect of the solid boundaries on the velocities of the organism. Experimental observations show that Paramecium executes helical trajectories that slowly transition to straight lines as the diameter of the capillary tubes decreases. We predict the swimming velocity in capillaries by modeling the system as a confined cylinder propagating longitudinal metachronal waves that create a finite pressure gradient. Comparing with experiments, we find that such pressure gradient considerations are necessary for modeling finite sized ciliary organisms in restrictive geometries.},

We observe that               Paramecia               execute directional sinusoidal trajectories in thick fluid films, whereas               Paramecia               meander around a localized region and execute frequent turns due to collisions with adjacent walls in thin fluid films. When               Paramecia               are further constrained in rectangular channels narrower than the length of the cell body, a fraction of meandering               Paramecia               buckle their body by pushing on the channel walls.

The analysis shows that               Paramecia               can utilize a fraction of its swimming power to execute the self-bending maneuver within the confined channel and no extra power may be required for this new kind of self-bending behavior.

Here we study in detail the effect of eukaryotic flagellates, represented by the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, on microparticles. Macro- and microscopic experiments reveal that microorganism-colloid interactions are dominated by rare close encounters leading to large displacements through direct entrainment. Simulations and theoretical modelling show that the ensuing particle dynamics can be understood in terms of a simple jump-diffusion process, combining standard diffusion with Poisson-distributed jumps. This heterogeneous dynamics is likely to depend on generic features of the near-field of swimming microorganisms with front-mounted flagella.},

In this setup, the quantum memory of the electron spin could be made more robust. Extending the lifetime and allowing multiple readouts of the quantum memory should prove a useful technique for quantum information processing.                        ,              Controlled interactions with nearby nuclear spins help improve the quantum memory of a nitrogen vacancy in diamond.           ,              Robust measurement of single quantum bits plays a key role in the realization of quantum computation and communication as well as in quantum metrology and sensing. We have implemented a method for the improved readout of single electronic spin qubits in solid-state systems. The method makes use of quantum logic operations on a system consisting of a single electronic spin and several proximal nuclear spin ancillae in order to repetitively readout the state of the electronic spin. Using coherent manipulation of a single nitrogen vacancy center in room-temperature diamond, full quantum control of an electronic-nuclear system consisting of up to three spins was achieved. We took advantage of a single nuclear-spin memory in order to obtain a 10-fold enhancement in the signal amplitude of the electronic spin readout. We also present a two-level, concatenated procedure to improve the readout by use of a pair of nuclear spin ancillae, an important step toward the realization of robust quantum information processors using electronic- and nuclear-spin qubits. Our technique can be used to improve the sensitivity and speed of spin-based nanoscale diamond magnetometers.},

One feasible theoretical explanation of a circular crack is the Xia-Hutchinson model, in which a preexisting track (flaw loop) in the film is necessary for initiating and propagating the crack on the circular path. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of dried deposition to support this model. Our results indicate that cracks along the circular trajectory can surprisingly ``pass'' across a 180 {$\mu$}m air gap. Moreover, two arc-path cracks originate in different areas and propagate to meet, forming a circular trajectory. These unexpected crack initiation and propagation indicate that the crack propagates alone the ``preformed'' track, experimentally confirming the hypothesis proposed by the Xia-Hutchinson model. The transition of the circular crack to a radial one indicates that the deposition microstructure is the dominant factor for the crack formation.},

In this way, the stochastic dynamics of many individual molecules yield essentially deterministic bulk behavior through ensemble averaging. As a result, their temporal evolution is governed by ensemble dynamics rather than by the behavior of an individual molecule or complex. Here, we present a general approach for the design of single-molecule clocks that permits quasideterministic control over the lifetime of single molecular interactions without any external synchronization. By coupling the dissociation of a bimolecular complex to a series of irreversible chemical steps, we interpose a well-defined time delay between binding and dissociation. The number and speed of irreversible steps can be varied to systematically tune both the lifetimes of complexes and the precision of the time delay, raising the prospect of localized timekeeping in nanoscale systems and devices.},

However, biological and synthetic active fluids defy these fundamental laws. Irrespective of their microscopic origin, confined active flows are intrinsically bistable, and therefore non-linear. As a consequence, their emergent patterns in channel networks are out of reach of available theories, and lack quantitative experiments. Here, we lay out the basic laws of active hydraulics. We show that active hydraulic flows are non-deterministic and yield degenerate streamline patterns ruled by frustration at nodes with an odd coordination number. More precisely, colloidal-roller experiments in trivalent networks reveal how active-hydraulic flows realize dynamical spin ices. The resulting streamline patterns split into two distinct classes of self-similar loops, which reflect the fractionalization of topological defects at the subchannel scales. Informed by our measurements, we formulate the laws of active hydraulics as a double spin model. A series of mappings on loop O(n) models then allow us to exactly predict the geometry of the degenerate streamlines. We expect our fundamental understanding to provide robust design rules for active microfluidic devices, and to offer unanticipated avenues to understand the motion of living cells and organisms in complex habitats.},

  abstract = {We introduce a deterministic model for scale-free networks, whose degree distribution follows a power law with the exponent {$\gamma$}. At each time step, each vertex generates its offspring, whose number is proportional to the degree of that vertex with proportionality constant m-1 (m{$>$}1). We consider the two cases: First, each offspring is connected to its parent vertex only, forming a tree structure. Second, it is connected to both its parent and grandparent vertices, forming a loop structure. We find that both models exhibit power-law behaviors in their degree distributions with the exponent {$\gamma$}=1+ln(2m-1)/lnm. Thus, by tuning m, the degree exponent can be adjusted in the range, 2{$<\gamma<$}3. We also solve analytically a mean shortest-path distance d between two vertices for the tree structure, showing the small-world behavior, that is, d{$\sim$}lnN/ln\textasciimacron k, where N is system size, and \textasciimacron k is the mean degree. Finally, we consider the case that the number of offspring is the same for all vertices, and find that the degree distribution exhibits an exponential-decay behavior.},

Assuming conservation of potential enstrophy and energy, we maximize a nonextensive entropy function to obtain the azimuthally averaged vorticity as a function of radial position. The predicted vorticity profile is in good accord with the observations. A nonextensive formalism is appropriate because long-range correlations between small-scale vortices give rise to large coherent structures in the turbulence. We also derive probability distribution functions for the vorticity from both extensive and nonextensive entropies, and we find that the prediction from nonextensive theory is in better accord with experiment, especially in the tails of the distribution function. The nonextensive parameter q has the value 1.9{$\pm$}0.2.},

  abstract = {We unify two approaches that have been taken to explain the non-Gaussian probability distribution functions (PDFs) obtained in measurements of longitudinal velocity differences in turbulence, and we apply our approach to Couette-Taylor turbulence data. The first approach we consider was developed by Castaing and co-workers, who obtained the non-Gaussian velocity difference PDF from a superposition of Gaussian distributions for subsystems that have a particular energy dissipation rate at a fixed length scale [Castaing et al., Physica D 46, 177 (1990)]. Another approach was proposed by Beck and Cohen, who showed that the observed PDFs can be obtained from a superposition of Gaussian velocity difference PDFs in subsystems conditioned on the value of an intensive variable (inverse ``effective temperature'') in each subsystem [Beck and Cohen, Physica A 322, 267 (2003)]. The intensive variable was defined for subsystems assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, but no method was proposed for determining the size of a subsystem. We show that the Castaing and Beck-Cohen methods are related, and we present a way to determine subsystem size in the Beck-Cohen method. The application of our approach to Couette-Taylor turbulence (Reynolds number 540 000) yields a log-normal distribution of the intensive parameter, and the resultant velocity difference PDF agrees well the observed non-Gaussian velocity difference PDFs.},

  abstract = {The statistical mechanical description of two-dimensional inviscid fluid turbulence is reconsidered. Using this description, we make predictions about turbulent flow in a rapidly rotating laboratory annulus. Measurements on the continuously forced, weakly dissipative flow reveal coherent vortices in a mean zonal flow. Statistical mechanics has two crucial requirements for equilibrium: statistical independence of macro-cells (subsystems) and additivity of invariants of macro-cells. We use additivity to select the appropriate Casimir invariants from the infinite set available in vortex dynamics, and we do this in such a way that the exchange of micro-cells within a macro-cell does not alter an invariant of a macro-cell. A novel feature of the present study is our choice of macro-cells, which are continuous phase space curves based on mean values of the streamfunction. Quantities such as energy and enstrophy can be defined on each curve, and these lead to a local canonical distribution that is also defined on each curve. Our approach leads to the prediction that on a mean streamfunction curve there should be a linear relation between the ensemble-averaged potential vorticity and the time-averaged streamfunction, and our laboratory data are in good accord with this prediction. Further, the approach predicts that although the probability distribution function for potential vorticity in the entire system is non-Gaussian, the distribution function of micro-cells should be Gaussian on the macro-cells, i.e., for curves defined by mean values of the streamfunction. This prediction is also supported by the data. While the statistical mechanics approach used was motivated by and applied to experiments on turbulence in a rotating annulus, the approach is quite general and is applicable to a large class of Hamiltonian systems.},

We also explore frequency dependencies and other geometric shapes of confinement.},

A superhelical structure may be thought of as a helix whose axial centerline is not straight, but also a helix. We examine the particular case in which these two superimposed helices have different handedness, and employ a combination of experimental, analytic, and computational methods to determine the rotational velocity of superhelical bodies being towed through a very viscous fluid. We find that the direction and rate of the rotation of the body is a result of competition between the two superimposed helices; for small axial helix amplitude, the body dynamics is controlled by the short-pitched helix, while there is a crossover at larger amplitude to control by the axial helix. We find far better, and excellent, agreement of our experimental results with numerical computations based upon the method of Regularized Stokeslets than upon the predictions of classical resistive force theory.},

The Strouhal number (a ratio of lateral to forward velocity) of C. elegans significantly decreases in a saturated particulate medium (0.50{$\pm$}0.13) in comparison to a fluid without particles (1.6{$\pm$}0.27). This result was unexpected due to the generally low performance of a body moving in a high drag medium. In our model, a saturated granular system is approximated as a porous medium where only the hydrodynamic forces on the body are considered. Combining these assumptions with resistive force theory, we find that a porous medium provides more asymmetric drag on a slender body, and consequently that C. elegans locomotes with a greater distance per undulation.},

First, we review the previously known complex potential of a moving thin plate to describe circulation and pressure around the body. Then, the impact force in diving or thrust force in swimming and flying are evaluated from the potential flow model. For the impact force, we show that the slamming or impact force of various ellipsoid-shaped bodies of animals increases with animal weight, however, the impact pressure does not vary much. For fliers, birds and bats follow a linear correlation between thrust lift force and animal weight. For swimming animals, we present a scaling of swimming speed as a balance of thrust force with drag, which is verified with biological data. Under this framework, three distinct animal behaviors (i.e., swimming, flying, and diving) are similar in that a thin appendage displaces and pressurizes a fluid, but different in regards to the surroundings, being either fully immersed in a fluid or at a fluid interface.},

We use a novel two-color, three-dimensional Lagrangian tracking technique to follow simultaneously the body and the flagella of a wild-type Escherichia coli. We observe long surface residence times and surface escape corresponding mostly to immediately antecedent tumbling. A motility model accounting for a large behavioral variability in run-time duration reproduces all experimental findings and gives new insights into surface trapping efficiency.},

Such environments exhibit non-Newtonian flow properties, drastically affecting the locomotion of microorganisms1\textendash 5. Although the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of swimming flagellated bacteria in simple Newtonian fluids has been well developed6\textendash 9, our understanding of bacterial motility in complex non-Newtonian fluids is less mature10,11. Even after six decades of research, fundamental questions about the nature and origin of bacterial motility enhancement in polymer solutions are still under debate12\textendash 23. Here we show that flagellated bacteria in dilute colloidal suspensions display quantitatively similar motile behaviours to those in dilute polymer solutions, in particular a universal particle-size-dependent motility enhancement up to 80\% accompanied by a strong suppression of bacterial wobbling18,24. By virtue of the hard-sphere nature of colloids, whose size and volume fraction we vary across experiments, our results shed light on the long-standing controversy over bacterial motility enhancement in complex fluids and suggest that polymer dynamics may not be essential for capturing the phenomenon12\textendash 23. A physical model that incorporates the colloidal nature of complex fluids quantitatively explains bacterial wobbling dynamics and mobility enhancement in both colloidal and polymeric fluids. Our findings contribute to the understanding of motile behaviours of bacteria in complex fluids, which are relevant for a wide range of microbiological processes25 and for engineering bacterial swimming in complex environments26,27.},

Using our analytic approximation, we propose an experimentally realizable Hodgkin-Huxley iontronic circuit where micrometer cones take on the role of sodium and potassium channels.

This hydrodynamic phenomenon is dominant below a critical shear rate and robust against Brownian motion and cell tumbling. We deduce that individual bacteria entering a flow system can rapidly migrate upstream ({$>$}20 mm/s) much faster than a gradually advancing biofilm. Given a bacterial population with a distribution of sizes and swim speeds, local shear rate near the surface determines the dominant hydrodynamic mode for motility, i.e., circular or random trajectories for low shear rates, positive rheotaxis for moderate flow, and sideways swimming at higher shear rates. Faster swimmers can move upstream more rapidly and at higher shear rates, as expected. Interestingly, we also find on average that both swim speed and upstream motility are independent of cell aspect ratio.},

In stark contrast with monodisperse systems, we find that polydispersity stabilizes a homogeneous active liquid at arbitrary large persistence times, characterized by remarkable velocity correlations and irregular turbulent flows. For all persistence values, the active fluid undergoes a nonequilibrium glass transition at large density. This is accompanied by collective motion, whose nature evolves from near-equilibrium spatially heterogeneous dynamics at small persistence, to a qualitatively different intermittent dynamics when persistence is large. This latter regime involves a complex time evolution of the correlated displacement field.},

Although GASP mutants are competitors with wild-type bacteria, we find that the 2 strains cooperate to maximize fitness (long-term total productivity) via spatial segregation: despite their very close genomic kinship, wild-type populations associate with wild-type populations and GASP populations with GASP populations. Thus, wild-type and GASP strains avoid each other locally, yet fitness is enhanced for both strains globally. This computation of fitness enhancement emerges from the local interaction among cells but maximizes global densities. At present we do not understand how fluctuations in both spatial and temporal dimensions lead to the emergent computation and how multilevel aggregates produce this collective adaptation.},

Some aquatic animals smaller than the capillary length are able to jump out while others are not, as observed in some marine copepods. To understand the dynamics of jumping out of the water\textendash air interface, we perform physical experiments by shooting a spherical particle towards the liquid\textendash air interface from below. Experimental results show that the particle either penetrates or bounces back from the interface, depending on the particle and fluid properties, and the impact velocity. The transition from bouncing to penetration regimes, which is theoretically predicted based on a particle force balance, is in good agreement with both physical experiments and plankton behavioural data.},

Experimentally, high-speed imaging systems with optical light or x-ray illumination are employed to accurately measure the spreading motion and dynamic contact angle of the contact line. Millimetric spheres are controlled to descend with a constant speed ranging from 3.2 x 104 to 0.79 m/s. We observed three different spreading stages over a sinking sphere, which depends on the contact line velocity and contact angle. These stages consistently showed the characteristics of capillarity-driven spreading as the contact line spreads faster with a higher contact angle. The contact line velocity is observed to follow a classical capillary-viscous model at a higher Ohnesorge number ({$>$} 0.02). For the cases with a relatively low Ohnesorge number ({$<$} 0.02), the contact line velocity is significantly lower than the speed predicted by the capillary-viscous balance. This indicates the existence of an additional opposing force (inertia), which is a similar transition from capillary viscous to capillary-inertia balances found in drop-impact dynamics. Additionally, we observed the linear relation between the contact line velocity and the sphere sinking speed during the second stage, in which the contact line inertia is balanced with the impact pressure by a sphere at high inertia regimes.},

  abstract = {When a solid body rises from a bath, a liquid column is formed and stretched until pinch-off occurs at different locations and times. In the present paper, we study the temporal and spatial evolution of a less viscous liquid column extracted by an accelerating sphere from a bath. At high acceleration, the observed liquid column has the shape of an up-pointing cone, which implies that the column near the sphere is stretched so quickly that the liquid cannot keep up with it. This causes the liquid column to pinch off at the upper location. At low accelerations, a liquid column pinches off at a lower location near the free surface. The shift in the pinch-off location is explained by the axial velocity-gradient profile in the liquid column. The numerical results show that the gradient of the axial velocity near the sphere increases when the solid sphere has a higher acceleration. As a result, at high accelerations, the axial velocity gradient is responsible for the necking and pinching off at the upper location of the liquid column. At low sphere accelerations, the column pinches off at the lower location by the strong Laplace pressure due to the higher gradient of the interfacial curvature between the column and the bath. Next the pinch-off time is observed to decrease as the acceleration increases regardless of the pinch-off location. We use a linear stability analysis to predict the pinch-off time as the inverse of the growth rate in the dispersion relation.},

Raindrop impact is known to be a mechanism for dispersing micron-sized pathogenic spores. However, previous studies have focused only on wet splash droplets formed by raindrop impact, which our results suggest are only a minor contributor to spore dispersal. Our experiments show the importance of air vortices resulting from the drop impacts to disperse spores beyond the laminar boundary layer, with the potential for transport over long distances.           ,                             Raindrop impact on infected plants can disperse micron-sized propagules of plant pathogens (e.g., spores of fungi). Little is known about the mechanism of how plant pathogens are liberated and transported due to raindrop impact. We used high-speed photography to observe thousands of dry-dispersed spores of the rust fungus               Puccinia triticina               being liberated from infected wheat plants following the impact of a single raindrop. We revealed that an air vortex ring was formed during the raindrop impact and carried the dry-dispersed spores away from the surface of the host plant. The maximum height and travel distance of the airborne spores increased with the aid of the air vortex. This unique mechanism of vortex-induced dispersal dynamics was characterized to predict trajectories of spores. Finally, we found that the spores transported by the air vortex can reach beyond the laminar boundary layer of leaves, which would enable the long-distance transport of plant pathogens through the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Many biological surfaces of animals and plants (e.g., bird feathers, insect wings, plant leaves, etc.) are superhydrophobic with rough surfaces at different length scales. Previous studies have focused on a simple drop-bouncing behavior on biological surfaces with low-speed impacts. However, we observed that an impacting drop at high speeds exhibits more complicated dynamics with unexpected shock-like patterns: Hundreds of shock-like waves are formed on the spreading drop, and the drop is then abruptly fragmented along with multiple nucleating holes. Such drop dynamics result in the rapid retraction of the spreading drop and thereby a more than twofold decrease in contact time. Our results may shed light on potential biological advantages of hypothermia risk reduction for endothermic animals and spore spreading enhancement for fungi via wave-induced drop fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Water stuck in the ear is a common problem during showering, swimming or other water activities. Having water trapped in the ear canal for a long time can lead to ear infections and possibly result in hearing loss. A common strategy for emptying water from the ear canal is to shake the head, where high acceleration helps remove the water. In this present study, we rationalize the underlying mechanism of water ejection/removal from the ear canal by performing experiments and developing a stability theory. From the experiments, we measure the critical acceleration to remove the trapped water inside different sizes of canals. Our theoretical model, modified from the Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability, can explain the critical acceleration observed in experiments, which strongly depends on the radius of the ear canal. The resulting critical acceleration tends to increase, especially in smaller ear canals, which indicates that shaking heads for water removal can be more laborious and potentially threatening to children due to their small size of the ear canal compared with adults.},

While a large body of knowledge exists on the phenotypes of planktonic and of sessile cells in mature biofilms, our understanding of what happens when bacteria change from the planktonic to the sessile state is still very incomplete. Fundamental questions are unanswered: for instance, how do bacteria sense that they are in contact with a surface, and what are the very initial cellular responses to surface contact. Here, we review the current knowledge on the signals that bacteria could perceive once they attach to a surface, the signal transduction systems that could be involved in sensing the surface contact and the cellular responses that are triggered as a consequence to surface contact ultimately leading to biofilm formation. Finally, as the main obstacle in investigating the initial responses to surface contact has been the difficulty to experimentally study the dynamic response of single cells upon surface attachment, we also review recent experimental approaches that could be employed to study bacterial surface sensing, which ultimately could lead to an improved understanding of how biofilm formation could be prevented.},

Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we measure the distributions and auto-correlation functions of force and torque exerted by active particles on the tracer. The tracer experiences a finite average force along its polar axis, while all the correlation functions show exponential decay in time. Using these insights we construct the full coarse-grained Langevin description for tracer position and orientation, where the active particles are subsumed into an effective self-propulsion force and exponentially correlated noise for both translations and rotations. The ensuing mesoscopic dynamics can be described in terms of five dimensionless parameters. We perform a thorough parameter study of the mean squared displacement, which illustrates how the different parameters influence the tracer dynamics, which crosses over from a ballistic to diffusive motion. We also demonstrate that the distribution of tracer displacements evolves from a non-Gaussian shape at early stages to a Gaussian behavior for sufficiently long times. Finally, for a given set of microscopic parameters, we establish a procedure to estimate the matching parameters of our effective model, and show that the resulting dynamics is in a very good quantitative agreement with the one obtained in Brownian dynamics simulations.},

Geometric boundaries often enforce different spatio-temporal patterns compared to unconfined environment and thus provide a platform to control the behavior of active matter. Here, we report collective dynamics of active particles enclosed by soft, deformable boundary, that is responsive to the particles' activity. We reveal that a quasi two-dimensional fluid droplet enclosing motile colloids powered by the Quincke effect (Quincke rollers) exhibits strong shape fluctuations with a power spectrum consistent with active fluctuations driven by particle-interface collisions. A broken detailed balance confirms the nonequilibrium nature of the shape dynamics. We further find that rollers self-organize into a single drop-spanning vortex, which can undergo a spontaneous symmetry breaking and vortex splitting. The droplet acquires motility while the vortex doublet exists. Our findings provide insights into the complex collective behavior of active colloidal suspensions in soft confinement.},

Stokes equation for a nematic stress tensor is written with the Green function and solved in the k-space for anisotropic Leslie viscosity coefficients under the limit of leading isotropic viscosity coefficient. Analytical expressions for the Green function are obtained that are used to compute the flow of monopole or dipole swimmers at various alignments of the swimmers with respect to the homogeneous director field. Flow profile is also solved for the flow sources/sinks and source dipoles showing clear emergence of anisotropy in the magnitude of flow profile as the result of fluid anisotropic viscosity. The range of validity of the presented analytical solutions is explored, as compared to exact numerical solutions of the Stokes equation. This work is a contribution towards understanding elementary flow motifs and profiles in fluid environments that are distinctly affected by anisotropic viscosity, offering analytic insight, which could be of relevance to a range of systems from microswimmers, active matter to microfluidics.},

Through theory and simulations, we demonstrate how single-nbit operations can be implemented using electric fields, to construct LC analogs of Pauli, Hadamard, and other elementary logic gates. Using nematoelastic interactions, we show how four-nbit configurations can realize universal classical NOR and NAND gates. Last, we demonstrate the implementation of generalized logical functions that take values on the Poincar\'e-Bloch sphere. These results open a route toward the implementation of classical digital and nonclassical continuous computation strategies in topological soft matter systems.},

In particular, transition rates over asymmetric energy barriers can be unbalanced by having different effective temperatures over the two slopes of the barrier. By varying the type of active noise, we find that equal values of diffusivity and persistence time may produce strongly varied effective temperatures and thus stationary distributions.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are characterized by complex dynamics involving enhanced swimming speeds, large-scale correlated motions and enhanced diffusivities of embedded tracer particles. Understanding this dynamics is of fundamental interest and also has relevance to biological systems. The observed collective dynamics has been interpreted as the onset of a hydrodynamic instability, of the quiescent isotropic state of pushers, swimmers with extensile force dipoles, above a critical threshold proportional to the swimmer concentration. In this work, we develop a particle-based model to simulate a suspension of hydrodynamically interacting rod-like swimmers to estimate this threshold. Unlike earlier simulations, the velocity disturbance field due to each swimmer is specified in terms of the intrinsic swimmer stress alone, as per viscous slender-body theory. This allows for a computationally efficient kinematic simulation where the interaction law between swimmers is known               a priori               . The neglect of induced stresses is of secondary importance since the aforementioned instability arises solely due to the intrinsic swimmer force dipoles.                                         Our kinematic simulations include, for the first time, intrinsic decorrelation mechanisms found in bacteria, such as tumbling and rotary diffusion. To begin with, we simulate so-called straight swimmers that lack intrinsic orientation decorrelation mechanisms, and a comparison with earlier results serves as a proof of principle. Next, we simulate suspensions of swimmers that tumble and undergo rotary diffusion, as a function of the swimmer number density                                                                      \$(n)\$                                               , and the intrinsic decorrelation time (the average duration between tumbles,                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash it\textbackslash tau\}\$                                               , for tumblers, and the inverse of the rotary diffusivity,                                                                      \$D\_\{r\}\^\{-1\}\$                                               , for rotary diffusers). The simulations, as a function of the decorrelation time, are carried out with hydrodynamic interactions (between swimmers) turned off and on, and for both pushers and pullers (swimmers with contractile force dipoles). The `interactions-off' simulations allow for a validation based on analytical expressions for the tracer diffusivity in the stable regime, and reveal a non-trivial box size dependence that arises with varying strength of the hydrodynamic interactions. The `interactions-on' simulations lead us to our main finding: the existence of a box-size-independent parameter that characterizes the onset of instability in a pusher suspension, and is given by                                                                      \$nUL\^\{2\}\{\textbackslash it\textbackslash tau\}\$                                               for tumblers and                                                                      \$nUL\^\{2\}/D\_\{r\}\$                                               for rotary diffusers; here,                                                                      \$U\$                                               and                                                                      \$L\$                                               are the swimming speed and swimmer length, respectively.

  abstract = {Complex and active fluids find broad applications in flows through porous materials. Nontrivial rheology can couple to porous microstructure leading to surprising flow patterns and associated transport properties in geophysical, biological, and industrial systems. Viscoelastic instabilities are highly sensitive to pore geometry and can give rise to chaotic velocity fluctuations. A number of recent studies have begun to untangle how the pore-scale geometry influences the sample-scale flow topology and the resulting dispersive transport properties of these complex systems. Beyond classical rheological properties, active colloids and swimming cells exhibit a range of unique properties, including reduced effective viscosity, collective motion, and random walks, that present novel challenges to understanding their mechanics and transport in porous media flows. This review article aims to provide a brief overview of essential, fundamental concepts followed by an in-depth summary of recent developments in this rapidly evolving field. The chosen topics are motivated by applications, and new opportunities for discovery are highlighted.},

We perform Brownian dynamics simulations of active stiff polymers undergoing run-reverse dynamics, and so mimic bacterial swimming, in porous media. In accord with experiments of Escherichia coli, the polymer dynamics are characterized by trapping phases interrupted by directed hopping motion through the pores. Our findings show that the spreading of active agents in porous media can be optimized by tuning their run lengths, which we rationalize using a coarse-grained model. More significantly, we discover a geometric criterion for the optimal spreading, which emerges when their run lengths are comparable to the longest straight path available in the porous medium. Our criterion unifies results for porous media with disparate pore sizes and shapes and for run-and-tumble polymers. It thus provides a fundamental principle for optimal transport of active agents in densely-packed biological and environmental settings.},

Based on our experiments, we build a minimal model that quantitatively predicts the geometry of the scattering trajectories, and enhanced colloidal diffusion at long times. This quantitative confrontation between theory and experiments elucidates the microscopic origin of enhanced transport. Collisions are solely ruled by stochastic contact interactions responsible both for genuine anomalous diffusion at short times and enhanced diffusion at long times with no ballistic regime at any scale.},

Here we review the biophysical and mechanical principles of locomotion at the small scales relevant to cell swimming, tens of micrometers and below. At this scale, inertia is unimportant and the Reynolds number is small. Our emphasis is on the simple physical picture and fundamental flow physics phenomena in this regime. We first give a brief overview of the mechanisms for swimming motility, and of the basic properties of flows at low Reynolds number, paying special attention to aspects most relevant for swimming such as resistance matrices for solid bodies, flow singularities and kinematic requirements for net translation. Then we review classical theoretical work on cell motility, in particular early calculations of swimming kinematics with prescribed stroke and the application of resistive force theory and slender-body theory to flagellar locomotion. After examining the physical means by which flagella are actuated, we outline areas of active research, including hydrodynamic interactions, biological locomotion in complex fluids, the design of small-scale artificial swimmers and the optimization of locomotion strategies.},

Most bacteria can move on their own, and the majority of motile bacteria are able to swim in viscous fluids using slender helical appendages called flagella. Low\textendash Reynolds number hydrodynamics is at the heart of the ability of flagella to generate propulsion at the micrometer scale. In fact, fluid dynamic forces impact many aspects of bacteriology, ranging from the ability of cells to reorient and search their surroundings to their interactions within mechanically and chemically complex environments.

To unravel ubiquitous characteristics that complex networks may have in common, we adopt the clustering coefficient as the probability measure, and present a systematic analysis of various types of complex networks from the perspective of statistical self-similarity. We find that the probability distribution of the clustering coefficient is best characterized by the multifractal; moreover, the support of the measure had a fractal dimension. These two features enable us to describe complex networks in a unified way; at the same time, offer unforeseen possibilities to comprehend complex networks.},

In most studies, either the particle size or the concentration of nanofluid is considered as a factor in the formation of the residue pattern. This work aims to investigate the effect of both particle size and concentration on the residue pattern. A comprehensive study was made of the residue patterns of Al2O3 and TiO2 aqueous nanofluid droplets on different substrates (i.e. glass, stainless steel and Teflon). It was found that a ring-shaped pattern was formed at low concentrations and small particle sizes, while a uniform pattern was formed at high concentrations and large particle sizes for Al2O3 nanofluids. In addition, only ring-shaped residue patterns were observed for all concentrations of TiO2 nanofluids. In the case of different substrates, on a material with a high contact angle with water, it was difficult to form a ring-shaped pattern. The widths of the ring-shaped pattern were analyzed as well. The results showed that the width of the ring-shaped pattern was larger for small particles. The materials of substrate and nanoparticle also influenced the width.},

One recent and extensively studied example is the advent of optomechanics that explores the radiation pressure-induced nonlinearity in a solid micro-resonator. Instead of using a solid resonator, we studied a liquid droplet resonator in which optical pressure could actively interact with the fluid interface. The droplet resonator supported high-quality whispering gallery modes along its equatorial plane, which produced a radiation pressure that counterbalances the interfacial tension, resulting in a droplet with damped harmonic oscillation. A major goal of this study was to demonstrate that such a novel and all-liquid platform could lead to a single-photon-level nonlinearity at room temperature. If successful, such a highly nonlinear system may lead to new research paradigms in photonics, fluid mechanics, as well as quantum information science.},

The air film entrapped inside the dimple is a critical factor affecting the sequential dynamics after coalescence and causing defects like the pinhole. Meanwhile, in the coalescence dynamics of an electrified droplet, the droplet's bottom interfaces change to a conical shape, and droplet contact the substrate directly without dimple formation. In this work, the mechanism for the dimple's suppression (interfacial change to conical shape) was studied investigating the effect of electric pressure. The electric stress acting on a droplet interface shows the nonlinear electric pressure adding to the uniform droplet pressure. This electric stress locally deforms the droplet's bottom interface to a conical shape and consequentially enables it to overcome the air pressure beneath the droplet. The electric pressure, calculated from numerical tracking for interface and electrostatic simulation, was at least 108 times bigger than the air pressure at the center of the coalescence. This work helps toward understanding the effect of electric stress on droplet coalescence and in the optimization of conditions in solution-based techniques like printing and coating.},

We use particle image velocimetry to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, we find that the vortex areas comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed, which allows us to extract the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale on the ATP concentration, which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude of the active stress. Our data suggest a possible mapping between the ATP concentration and the active stress that is based on the Michaelis\textendash Menten kinetics that governs the motion of individual kinesin motors.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of effective temperatures based on fluctuation-dissipation relations in a model of an active fluid composed of self-propelled hard disks. We first investigate the relevance of effective temperatures in the dilute and moderately dense fluids. We find that a unique effective temperature does not in general characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics of the active fluid over this broad range of densities, because fluctuation-dissipation relations yield a lengthscale-dependent effective temperature. By contrast, we find that the approach to a non-equilibrium glass transition at very large densities is accompanied by the emergence of a unique effective temperature shared by fluctuations at all lengthscales. This suggests that an effective thermal dynamics generically emerges at long times in very dense suspensions of active particles due to the collective freezing occurring at non-equilibrium glass transitions.},

Such patterns have mainly been explored for identical circle swimmers, while real-world circle swimmers, typically possess a frequency distribution. Here we show that even the simplest mixture of (velocity-aligning) circle swimmers with two different frequencies, hosts a complex world of superstructures: The most remarkable example comprises a microflock pattern, formed in one species, while the other species phase separates and forms a macrocluster, coexisting with a gas phase. Here, one species microphase-separates and selects a characteristic length scale, whereas the other one macrophase separates and selects a density. A second notable example, here occurring in an isotropic system, are patterns comprising two different characteristic length scales, which are controllable via frequency and swimming speed of the individual particles.},

In many examples, such as bacterial systems and biofilament assays, constituent units are elongated and can give rise to local nematic orientational order. Such ``active nematics'' systems have attracted much attention from both theorists and experimentalists. However, despite intense research efforts, data-driven quantitative modeling has not been achieved, a situation mainly due to the lack of systematic experimental data and to the large number of parameters of current models. Here, we introduce an active nematics system made of swarming filamentous bacteria. We simultaneously measure orientation and velocity fields and show that the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be quantitatively reproduced by a type of microscopic model for active suspensions whose important parameters are all estimated from comprehensive experimental data. This provides unprecedented access to key effective parameters and mechanisms governing active nematics. Our approach is applicable to different types of dense suspensions and shows a path toward more quantitative active matter research.},

Studies of bacterial collective movement have largely focused on swarming motility mediated by flagella or pili, in the absence of a biofilm. Here, we describe a unique mode of collective movement by a self-propelled, surface-associated biofilm-like multicellular structure. Flavobacterium johnsoniae cells, which move by gliding motility, self-assemble into spherical microcolonies with EPS cores when observed by an under-oil open microfluidic system. Small microcolonies merge, creating larger ones. Microscopic analysis and computer simulation indicate that microcolonies move by cells at the base of the structure, attached to the surface by one pole of the cell. Biochemical and mutant analyses show that an active process drives microcolony self-assembly and motility, which depend on the bacterial gliding apparatus. We hypothesize that this mode of collective bacterial movement on solid surfaces may play potential roles in biofilm dynamics, bacterial cargo transport, or microbial adaptation. However, whether this collective motility occurs on plant roots or soil particles, the native environment for F. johnsoniae, is unknown.},

A, vol. 374, 2010, p. 3487), where fluid particle displacements due to inviscid swimmers are added to produce an effective diffusivity. Here we show that, for the viscous case, the swimmers cannot be assumed to swim an infinite distance, even though their total mass displacement is finite. Instead, the largest contributions to particle displacement, and hence to mixing, arise from random changes of direction of swimming and are dominated by the far-field stresslet term in our simple model. We validate the results by numerical simulation. We also calculate non-zero Reynolds number corrections to the effective diffusivity. Finally, we show that displacements due to randomly swimming squirmers exhibit probability distribution functions with exponential tails and a short-time superdiffusive regime, as found previously by several authors. In our case, the exponential tails are due to `sticking' near the stagnation points on the squirmer's surface.},

This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski's equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the DeltaG profile of the stretching process to within k(B)T/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski's equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems.

It is found that a force singularity parallel to the two planes has a far field behaviour of source and image for the parallel components (a two dimensional source doublet of height-dependent strength) whereas the normal component, and all fields due to a force singularity normal to the planes, die out exponentially. Velocity fields are compared with those of the one plane case. An estimate of the influence of the second wall and when its effect can be disregarded is obtained.},

The dynamical mechanism during the transition is explored through examining the diffusion trajectories of the nanoparticles confined at the interfaces.

The experimental results indicate that the crack number or crack spacing presents a general dependence on the substrate roughness, despite the orientation of the substrate textures. Interestingly, the crack spacing decreases with the increase of the roughness. Two possible mechanisms are proposed to understand the dependence of the cracks on roughness. Firstly, the concentration reduction of the drying suspension due to collecting colloidal particles from the substrate textures decreases the crack spacing. Secondly, stress concentration resulting from the defects (the notches in textures) in the dried deposition enhances crack formation. However, a quantitative estimation by the calculation of the stress concentrating factors reveals that the notch of the substrate textures dominates crack variation. The results here bring forth a practical method for controlling the crack orientation and suppression, and a potential application to crack-free coatings, films and paintings during the drying of complex fluids.},

Here, we combine experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the dynamical regimes and morphological transitions of elastic Brownian filaments in a simple shear flow. Actin filaments are used as an experimental model system and their conformations are investigated through fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic channels. Simulations matching the experimental conditions are also performed using inextensible Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam theory and nonlocal slender-body hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations and agree quantitatively with observations. We demonstrate that filament dynamics in this system are primarily governed by a dimensionless elasto-viscous number comparing viscous drag forces to elastic bending forces, with thermal fluctuations playing only a secondary role. While short and rigid filaments perform quasi-periodic tumbling motions, a buckling instability arises above a critical flow strength. A second transition to strongly deformed shapes occurs at a yet larger value of the elasto-viscous number and is characterized by the appearance of localized high-curvature bends that propagate along the filaments in apparent ``snaking'' motions. A theoretical model for the as yet unexplored onset of snaking accurately predicts the transition and explains the observed dynamics. We present a complete characterization of filament morphologies and transitions as a function of elasto-viscous number and scaled persistence length and demonstrate excellent agreement between theory, experiments, and simulations.},

Here, using a microfluidic viscometer, we systematically measure the rheology of dilute Escherichia coli suspensions under different degrees of confinement. Our study reveals a strong confinement effect: the viscosity of bacterial suspensions decreases substantially when the confinement scale is comparable or smaller than the run length of bacteria. Moreover, we also investigate the microscopic dynamics of bacterial suspensions including velocity profiles, bacterial density distributions, and single bacterial dynamics in shear flows. These measurements allow us to construct a simple heuristic model based on the boundary layer of upstream swimming bacteria near confining walls, which qualitatively explains our experimental observations. Our study sheds light on the influence of the boundary layer of collective bacterial motions on the flow of confined bacterial suspensions. Our results provide a benchmark for testing different rheological models of active fluids and are useful for understanding the transport of microorganisms in confined geometries.},

  abstract = {Due to its inherent out-of-equilibrium nature, active matter in confinement may exhibit collective behavior absent in unconfined systems. Extensive studies have indicated that hydrodynamic or steric interactions between active particles and boundary play an important role in the emergence of collective behavior. However, besides introducing external couplings at the single-particle level, the confinement also induces an inhomogeneous density distribution due to particle-position correlations, whose effect on collective behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigate this effect in a minimal chiral active matter composed of self-spinning rotors through simulation, experiment, and theory. We find that the density inhomogeneity leads to a position-dependent frictional stress that results from interrotor friction and couples the spin to the translation of the particles, which can then drive a striking spatially oscillating collective motion of the chiral active matter along the confinement boundary. Moreover, depending on the oscillation properties, the collective behavior has three different modes as the packing fraction varies. The structural origins of the transitions between the different modes are well identified by the percolation of solid-like regions or the occurrence of defect-induced particle rearrangement. Our results thus show that the confinement-induced inhomogeneity, dynamic structure, and compressibility have significant influences on collective behavior of active matter and should be properly taken into account.},

  abstract = {Giant number fluctuations are often considered as a hallmark of the emergent nonequilibrium dynamics of active fluids. However, these anomalous density fluctuations have only been reported experimentally in two-dimensional dry active systems heretofore. Here, we investigate density fluctuations of bulk Escherichia coli suspensions, a paradigm of three-dimensional (3D) wet active fluids. Our experiments demonstrate the existence and quantify the scaling relation of giant number fluctuations in 3D bacterial suspensions. Surprisingly, the anomalous scaling persists at small scales in low-concentration suspensions well before the transition to active turbulence, reflecting the long-range nature of hydrodynamic interactions of 3D wet active fluids. To illustrate the origin of the density fluctuations, we measure the energy spectra of suspension flows and explore the density\textendash energy coupling in both the steady and transient states of active turbulence. A scale-invariant density-independent correlation between density fluctuations and energy spectra is uncovered across a wide range of length scales. In addition, our experiments show that the energy spectra of bacterial turbulence exhibit the scaling of 3D active nematic fluids, challenging the common view of dense bacterial suspensions as active polar fluids.},

In the present study, we examine the time-dependent spreading dynamics of a drop onto a curved hydrophobic surface. We also observed that a drop on a curved surface spreads farther than one on a flat surface. To further understand the spreading dynamics, a new analytical model is developed based on volume conservation and temporal energy balance. This model converges to previous models at the early stage and the final stage of droplet impact. We compared the new model with measured spreading lengths on various curved surfaces and impact speeds, which resulted in good agreement.},

Most previous studies focus on the formation and pinch-off dynamics of the air cavity, but only a few have investigated the long-term cavity dynamics after pinch-off. In this study, we examine the ripple formation following the pinch-off of an air cavity generated by a cone, with different cone angles and impact velocities. The amplitude and wavelength of these ripples are measured, and the force on the cone is experimentally determined. It was observed that the ripple amplitude and wavelength increase linearly with the cone impact velocity, which is predicted by our acoustic model of the compressible air cavity. In addition, the measured force exhibits distinct amplitudes and wavelengths. By measuring the length of the cavity, the resulting pressure variation was averaged inside the air cavity leading to a theoretical force amplitude, which matched our observations. We noted that the force wavelength also follows the same acoustic model, which agrees very well with the wavelength of the ripples.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            From a geometrical point of view, a non-sessile~leaf is composed of two parts: a large flat plate called the lamina, and a long beam called the petiole which connects the lamina to the branch/stem. While wind is exerting force (e.g. drag) on the lamina, the petiole undergoes twisting and bending motions. To survive in harsh abiotic conditions, leaves may have evolved to form in different shapes, resulting from a coupling between the lamina geometry and the petiole mechanical properties. In this study, we measure the shape of laminae from 120 simple leaf species (no leaflets). Leaves of the same species are found to be geometrically similar regardless of their size. From tensile/torsional tests, we characterize the bending rigidity (               EI               ) and the twisting rigidity (               GJ               ) of 15 petioles of 4 species in the Spring/Summer: Red Oak (               Quercus Rubra               ), American Sycamore (               Platanus occidentalis               ), Yellow Poplar (               Liriodendron tulipifera               ), and Sugar Maple (               Acer saccharum               ).

However, the evaporation-driven mechanical instabilities of dense consolidating bacterial suspensions have not been explored heretofore. Here, we report the formation of two different crack patterns of drying suspensions of Escherichia coli (E. coli) with distinct motile behaviors. Circular cracks are observed for wild-type E. coli with active swimming, whereas spiral-like cracks form for immotile bacteria. Using the elastic fracture mechanics and the poroelastic theory, we show that the formation of the circular cracks is determined by the tensile nature of the radial drying stress once the cracks are initiated by the local order structure of bacteria due to their collective swimming. Our study demonstrates the link between the microscopic swimming behaviors of individual bacteria and the mechanical instabilities and macroscopic pattern formation of drying bacterial films. The results shed light on the dynamics of active matter in a drying process and provide useful information for understanding various biological processes associated with drying bacterial suspensions.},

  abstract = {Tumbling, a characteristic feature of the motility and chemotactic response of peritrichously flagellated bacteria, has been examined by dark-field light microscopy and found to be intimately linked to major changes in the quaternary structure of the flagella. The normal structure of the flagella of Salmonella is a left-handed helix of wavelength 2{$\cdot$}3 {$\mu$}m and diameter 0{$\cdot$}4 {$\mu$}m. Under right-handed torsion generated when the rotary motor is operating in reverse (i.e. in a clockwise sense), the normal structure undergoes a discrete transition to an alternative structure, designated ``curly'', which is a right-handed helix of wavelength 1{$\cdot$}1 {$\mu$}m and diameter 0{$\cdot$}3 {$\mu$}m. The transition proceeds rapidly from the cell body outward but is, at any instant, confined to a very short region of the flagellum. The heteromorphous structure of a flagellum in transition consists of two portions, normal and curly, with a change in axial direction of 64\textdegree{} occurring at the transition region. The chaotic motion of the cell body, in reaction to a number of flagella which are rotating and in transition, constitutes the tumble. The induction of polymorphic transitions by mechanical force is confirmed by studies with motor and flagellar mutants, and with cells converted to curly flagellar phenotype by p-fluorophenylalanine. The phenomenon of polymorphic transitions was examined most extensively in Salmonella, but is also noted in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli and may therefore be a general feature of bacterial flagellar structure. The right-handedness of the curly structures induced mechanically or by incorporation of p-fluorophenylalanine is also found for the curly structures caused by mutation or pH/ionic strength changes (Shimada et al., 1975). The reasons for the specific interaction between mechanical and molecular forces are discussed.},

A roughly linear relation between swimming speed and flagellar rotation rate was observed. The ratio of swimming speed to flagellar rotation rate was 0.113 microns, which indicated that a cell progressed by 7\% of pitch of flagellar helix during one flagellar rotation. At each temperature, however, swimming speed had a tendency to saturate at high flagellar rotation rate. That is, the cell with a faster-rotating flagellum did not always swim faster. To analyze the bacterial motion, we proposed a model in which the torque characteristics of the flagellar motor were considered. The model could be analytically solved, and it qualitatively explained the experimental results. The discrepancy between the experimental and the calculated ratios of swimming speed to flagellar rotation rate was about 20\%. The apparent saturation in swimming speed was considered to be caused by shorter flagella that rotated faster but produced less propelling force.},

Berg and Turner (Nature. 278:349-351, 1979) indicated that the phenomenon was caused by a loose, quasi-rigid network formed by polymer molecules that were added to increase viscosity. We mathematically developed their concept by introducing two apparent viscosities and obtained results similar to the experimental data reported before. Addition of polymer improved the propulsion efficiency, which surpasses the decline in flagellar rotation rate, and the swimming speed increased with viscosity.},

We find that the standard picture of density accumulation in slow regions is qualitatively modified by active fluctuations, as stationary density profiles are generally not determined only by the mean self-propulsion speed landscape. As a result, activity gradients generically correlate the particle self-propulsion speed and orientation, leading to emergent polarization at interfaces pointing either towards dense or dilute regions depending on the amount of noise in the system. We discuss how these features affect the onset of motility induced phase separation. Our work provides a foundation for systematic studies of active matter self-organization in the presence of activity landscapes and active fluctuations.},

Solid boundaries can strongly influence a cell's propulsion mechanism, thus leading many flagellated bacteria to describe long circular trajectories stably entrapped by the surface. Experimental studies on near-surface bacterial motility have, however, neglected the fact that real environments have typical microstructures varying on the scale of the cells' motion. Here, we show that micro-obstacles influence the propagation of peritrichously flagellated bacteria on a flat surface in a non-monotonic way. Instead of hindering it, an optimal, relatively low obstacle density can significantly enhance cells' propagation on surfaces due to individual forward-scattering events. This finding provides insight on the emerging dynamics of chiral active matter in complex environments and inspires possible routes to control microbial ecology in natural habitats.},

  abstract = {Swimming cells often have to self-propel through fluids displaying non-Newtonian rheology. While past theoretical work seems to indicate that stresses arising from complex fluids should systematically hinder low-Reynolds number locomotion, experimental observations suggest that locomotion enhancement is possible. In this paper we propose a physical mechanism for locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. It is based on the fact that microstructured fluids will generically phase-separate near surfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers, which promote slip and decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. We use two models to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent slip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of viscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. Considering two canonical setups for low-Reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a two-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that phase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by orders of magnitude. We close by confronting our predictions with recent experimental results.},

To reproduce the effects of the experimentally observed persistence of the trajectories of the active particles we consider a Gaussian force having a non-vanishing correlation time               {$\tau$}               , whose finiteness is a measure of the activity of the system. With these ingredients we show that it is possible to develop a statistical mechanical approach similar to the one employed in the study of equilibrium liquids and to obtain the explicit form of the many-particle distribution function by means of the multidimensional unified colored noise approximation. Such a distribution plays a role analogous to the Gibbs distribution in equilibrium statistical mechanics and provides complete information about the microscopic state of the system. From here we develop a method to determine the one- and two-particle distribution functions in the spirit of the Born\textendash Green\textendash Yvon (BGY) equations of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The resulting equations which contain extra-correlations induced by the activity allow us to determine the stationary density profiles in the presence of external fields, the pair correlations and the pressure of active fluids. In the low density regime we obtained the effective pair potential               {$\phi$}               (               r               ) acting between two isolated particles separated by a distance,               r               , showing the existence of an effective attraction between them induced by activity. Based on these results, in the second half of the paper we propose a mean field theory as an approach simpler than the BGY hierarchy and use it to derive a van der Waals expression of the equation of state.},

By summing a recursive series of image systems, we derive a numerically tractable approximation to the three-dimensional flow fields of a stokeslet (point force) within a viscous film between a parallel no-slip surface and a no-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows produced by a force- and torque-free micro-swimmer. We also extend the exact solution of Liron \& Mochon (               J. Engng Maths               , vol.~10~(4), 1976, pp.~287\textendash 303) to the film geometry, which demonstrates that the image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields if the film is sufficiently thick compared to the swimmer size, and we derive the swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick-film case, we find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at the no-slip wall rather than the water\textendash air interface, but that higher-order multipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions, we propose an experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular swimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's three-dimensional position under a microscope.},

By combining experiments on three different species\textemdash Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Tetraselmis subcordiforms, and Oxyrrhis marina\textemdash with simulations and analytical modeling, we show that the fundamental physical process regulating proximity to a swimming microorganism is hydrodynamic particle entrainment. The resulting distribution of contact times is derived within the framework of Taylor dispersion as a competition between advection by the cell surface and microparticle diffusion, and predicts the existence of an optimal tracer size that is also observed experimentally. Spatial organization of flagella, swimming speed, and swimmer and tracer size influence entrainment features and provide tradeoffs that may be tuned to optimize the estimated probabilities for microbial interactions like predation and infection.},

The mechanisms of this `rheotaxis', the reorientation with respect to flow gradients, are still poorly understood. Here, we follow individual E. coli bacteria swimming at surfaces under shear flow using 3D Lagrangian tracking and fluorescent flagellar labelling. Three transitions are identified with increasing shear rate: Above a first critical shear rate, bacteria shift to swimming upstream. After a second threshold, we report the discovery of an oscillatory rheotaxis. Beyond a third transition, we further observe coexistence of rheotaxis along the positive and negative vorticity directions. A theoretical analysis explains these rheotaxis regimes and predicts the corresponding critical shear rates. Our results shed light on bacterial transport and reveal strategies for contamination prevention, rheotactic cell sorting, and microswimmer navigation in complex flow environments.},

These diamond nanosensors can readily be delivered into intact cells and even living organisms. However, applications beyond current proof-of-principle experiments require a substantial increase in sensitivity, which is generally limited by surface-noise-induced spin dephasing and relaxation. In this work, we significantly reduce magnetic surface noise by engineering core-shell structures, which in combination with dynamical decoupling result in qubit coherence times (T             2             ) ranging from 52{$\mu$}s to 87{$\mu$}s \textendash{} a drastic improvement over the 1.1{$\mu$}s to 35{$\mu$}s seen in bare particles. This improvement in spin coherence, combined with an overall increase in particle fluorescence, corresponds to an up to two-order-of-magnitude reduction in integration time. Probing qubit dynamics at a single particle level, furthermore, reveals that the noise characteristics fundamentally change from a bath with spins that rearrange their spatial configuration during the course of an experiment to a more dilute static bath. The observed results shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing spin dephasing in diamond nanocrystals and offer an effective noise mitigation strategy based on engineered core-shell structures.},

The algorithm can also be used to increase the spatial resolution of measurements by allowing smaller interrogation spots than those required for standard cross correlation techniques. The quality of the velocity measurements can be dramatically increased by averaging a series of instantaneous correlation functions, before determining the location of the signal peak, as opposed to the commonly used technique of estimating instantaneous velocity fields first and then averaging the velocity fields.

Using precisely controlled oxygen gradients in a microfluidic device, spanning the full spectrum of conditions from quasi-anoxic to oxic (60\,n\,mol/l\textendash 1\,m\,mol/l), we resolved B. subtilis' `oxygen preference conundrum' by demonstrating consistent migration towards maximum oxygen concentrations (`monotonic aerotaxis'). Surprisingly, the strength of aerotaxis was largely unchanged over three decades in oxygen concentration (131\,n\,mol/l\textendash 196\,{$\mu$}\,mol/l). We discovered that in this range B. subtilis responds to the logarithm of the oxygen concentration gradient, a rescaling strategy called `log-sensing' that affords organisms high sensitivity over a wide range of conditions. In these experiments, high-throughput single-cell imaging yielded the best signal-to-noise ratio of any microbial taxis study to date, enabling the robust identification of the first mathematical model for aerotaxis among a broad class of alternative models. The model passed the stringent test of predicting the transient aerotactic response despite being developed on steady-state data, and quantitatively captures both monotonic aerotaxis and log-sensing. Taken together, these results shed new light on the oxygen-seeking capabilities of B. subtilis and provide a blueprint for the quantitative investigation of the many other forms of microbial taxis.},

In this study, we examined in more detail the effect of weak acids on motility at various external pH values. A change of external pH over the range 5.0 to 7.8 hardly affected the swimming speed of E. coli cells in the absence of 34 mM potassium acetate. In contrast, the cells decreased their swimming speed significantly as external pH was shifted from pH 7.0 to 5.0 in the presence of 34 mM acetate. The total proton motive force of E. coli cells was not changed greatly by the presence of acetate. We measured the rotational rate of tethered E. coli cells as a function of external pH. Rotational speed decreased rapidly as the external pH was decreased, and at pH 5.0, the motor stopped completely. When the external pH was returned to 7.0, the motor restarted rotating at almost its original level, indicating that high intracellular proton (H+) concentration does not irreversibly abolish flagellar motor function. Both the swimming speeds and rotation rates of tethered cells of Salmonella also decreased considerably when the external pH was shifted from pH 7.0 to 5.5 in the presence of 20 mM benzoate. We propose that the increase in the intracellular proton concentration interferes with the release of protons from the torque-generating units, resulting in slowing or stopping of the motors.},

The kinetic barrier to spontaneous nucleation arises in part from positive cooperativity deriving from joint-neighbor capture, where stable capture of incoming monomers requires straddling multiple subunits on a filament end. For programmable DNA self-assembly, it is likewise desirable to suppress spontaneous nucleation to enable powerful capabilities such as all-or-nothing assembly of nanostructures larger than a single DNA origami, ultrasensitive detection, and more robust algorithmic assembly. However, existing DNA assemblies use monomers with low coordination numbers that present an effective kinetic barrier only for slow, near-reversible growth conditions. Here we introduce crisscross polymerization of elongated slat monomers that engage beyond nearest neighbors which sustains the kinetic barrier under conditions that promote fast, irreversible growth. By implementing crisscross slats as single-stranded DNA, we attain strictly seed-initiated nucleation of crisscross ribbons with distinct widths and twists.},

Considering the swimmer\textendash tracer hydrodynamic interactions at low Reynolds number and using a kinetic theory approach, it is shown that the induced diffusion coefficient is proportional to the swimmer concentration, their mean velocity and a coefficient                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               , as observed experimentally. This paper shows that                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases as a result of the interaction with solid surfaces. The coefficient                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               scales as the tracer\textendash swimmer cross-section times the mean square displacement produced by single scattering events, which depends on the swimmer propulsion forces. Considering simple swimmer models (acting on the fluid as two monopoles or as a force dipole), it is shown that                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases for decreasing swimming efficiencies. Close to solid surfaces, the swimming efficiency degrades and, consequently, the induced diffusion increases. Experiments on wild-type               Escherichia coli               in a Hele-Shaw cell, under buoyant conditions, are performed to measure the induced diffusion on tracers near surfaces. The modification of the suspension pH varies the swimmers' velocity over a wide range, allowing the                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               coefficient to be extracted with precision. It is found that solid surfaces modify the induced diffusion: decreasing the confinement height of the cell,                                                                      \$\textbackslash beta \$                                               increases by a factor of~4. The theoretical model reproduces this increase, although there are quantitative differences, probably attributed to the simplicity of the swimmer models and to the estimates for the parameters that model               E.~coli               .},

  abstract = {The postulational basis of classical thermodynamics has been expanded to incorporate equilibrium fluctuations. The main additional elements of the proposed thermodynamic theory are the concept of quasi-equilibrium states, a definition of nonequilibrium entropy, a fundamental equation of state in the entropy representation, and a fluctuation postulate describing the probability distribution of macroscopic parameters of an isolated system. Although these elements introduce a statistical component that does not exist in classical thermodynamics, the logical structure of the theory is different from that of statistical mechanics and represents an expanded version of thermodynamics. Based on this theory, we present a regular procedure for calculations of equilibrium fluctuations of extensive parameters, intensive parameters and densities in systems with any number of fluctuating parameters. The proposed fluctuation formalism is demonstrated by four applications: (1) derivation of the complete set of fluctuation relations for a simple fluid in three different ensembles; (2) fluctuations in finite-reservoir systems interpolating between the canonical and micro-canonical ensembles; (3) derivation of fluctuation relations for excess properties of grain boundaries in binary solid solutions, and (4) derivation of the grain boundary width distribution for pre-melted grain boundaries in alloys. The last two applications offer an efficient fluctuation-based approach to calculations of interface excess properties and extraction of the disjoining potential in pre-melted grain boundaries. Possible future extensions of the theory are outlined.},

Particles develop concentration profiles around them by dissolution, adsorption, or the reactivity of surface species. These gradients change the surface energy of the particles, driving both their self-propulsion and governing their interactions. Here, we uncover a regime in which solute gradients mediate interactions between slowly dissolving droplets without causing autophoresis. This decoupling allows us to directly measure the steady-state, repulsive force, which scales with interparticle distance as F{$\sim$}1/r2. Our results show that the dissolution process is diffusion rather than reaction rate limited, and the theoretical model captures the dependence of the interactions on droplet size and solute concentration, using a single fit parameter, l=16{$\pm$}3nm, which corresponds to the length scale of a swollen micelle. Our results shed light on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of particles with surface reactivity.},

  abstract = {Endocytosis of transmembrane receptors initiates via molecular interactions between the activated receptor and the endocytic machinery. A specific group of receptors, including the {$\beta$}1-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}1-AR), is internalized through a non-clathrin pathway known as Fast Endophilin Mediated Endocytosis (FEME). A key question is: how does the endocytic machinery assemble and how is it modulated by activated receptors during FEME. Here we show that endophilin, a major regulator of FEME, undergoes a phase transition into liquid-like condensates, which facilitates the formation of multi-protein assemblies by enabling the phase partitioning of endophilin binding proteins. The phase transition can be triggered by specific multivalent binding partners of endophilin in the FEME pathway such as the third intracellular loop (TIL) of the {$\beta$}1-AR, and the proline-rich-motifs of lamellipodin (LPD-PRMs). Other endocytic accessory proteins can either partition into, or target interfacial regions of, these condensate droplets. On the membrane, TIL promotes protein clustering in the presence of endophilin and LPD-PRMs. Our results demonstrate how the multivalent interactions between endophilin, LPD-PRMs and TIL regulate protein assembly formation on the membrane, providing mechanistic insights into the priming and initiation steps of FEME.},

We first show that individual colloidal rollers align with external flows, as would a classical spin with magnetic fields. Assembling polar active liquids from colloidal rollers, we experimentally demonstrate their hysteretic response: Confined colloidal flocks can proceed against external flows. We theoretically explain this collective robustness, using an active hydrodynamic description, and show how orientational elasticity and confinement protect the direction of collective motion. Finally, we exploit the intrinsic bistability of confined active flows to devise self-sustained microfluidic oscillators.},

  abstract = {Bacterial biofilms are complex surface attached communities of bacteria held together by self-produced polymer matrixs mainly composed of polysaccharides, secreted proteins, and extracellular DNAs. Bacterial biofilm formation is a complex process and can be described in five main phases: (i) reversible attachment phase, where bacteria non-specifically attach to surfaces; (ii) irreversible attachment phase, which involves interaction between bacterial cells and a surface using bacterial adhesins such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS); (iii) production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by the resident bacterial cells; (iv) biofilm maturation phase, in which bacterial cells synthesize and release signaling molecules to sense the presence of each other, conducing to the formation of microcolony and maturation of biofilms; and (v) dispersal/detachment phase, where the bacterial cells depart biofilms and comeback to independent planktonic lifestyle. Biofilm formation is detrimental in healthcare, drinking water distribution systems, food, and marine industries, etc. As a result, current studies have been focused toward control and prevention of biofilms. In an effort to get rid of harmful biofilms, various techniques and approaches have been employed that interfere with bacterial attachment, bacterial communication systems (quorum sensing, QS), and biofilm matrixs. Biofilms, however, also offer beneficial roles in a variety of fields including applications in plant protection, bioremediation, wastewater treatment, and corrosion inhibition amongst others. Development of beneficial biofilms can be promoted through manipulation of adhesion surfaces, QS and environmental conditions. This review describes the events involved in bacterial biofilm formation, lists the negative and positive aspects associated with bacterial biofilms, elaborates the main strategies currently used to regulate establishment of harmful bacterial biofilms as well as certain strategies employed to encourage formation of beneficial bacterial biofilms, and highlights the future perspectives of bacterial biofilms.},

This surprising liberation mechanism is enabled by the superhydrophobicity of wheat leaves, which promotes a jumping-droplet mode of condensation powered by the surface energy released from coalescence events. We found that urediniospores often adhere to the self-propelled condensate, resulting in liberation rates of approximately 10 cm               -2               h               -1               for leaves infected with rust.

The field of active matter focuses on understanding how the collective behaviours of internally driven components can give rise to these biological phenomena, while also striving to produce synthetic materials composed of active energy-consuming components. The synergistic approach of studying active matter in both living cells and reconstituted systems assembled from biochemical building blocks has the potential to transform our understanding of both cell biology and materials science. This methodology can provide insight into the fundamental principles that govern the dynamical behaviours of self-organizing subcellular structures, and can lead to the design of artificial materials and machines that operate away from equilibrium and can thus attain life-like properties. In this Review, we focus on active materials made of cytoskeletal components, highlighting the role of active stresses and how they drive self-organization of both cellular structures and macroscale materials, which are machines powered by nanomachines.},

Current tracking methods, based on a limited set of input parameters to identify bright objects, are ill-equipped to handle the spectrum of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and poor signal-to-noise ratios typically presented by submicron species in complex biological environments. Extensive user involvement is frequently necessary to optimize and execute tracking methods, which is not only inefficient but introduces user bias. To develop a fully automated tracking method, we developed a convolutional neural network for particle localization from image data, comprising over 6,000 parameters, and used machine learning techniques to train the network on a diverse portfolio of video conditions. The neural network tracker provides unprecedented automation and accuracy, with exceptionally low false positive and false negative rates on both 2D and 3D simulated videos and 2D experimental videos of difficult-to-track species.},

However, the generalizable effects of antibiotics on and the contribution of environmental variables to gut commensals remain unclear. To address this, we tracked microbiota dynamics with high temporal and taxonomic resolution during antibiotic treatment in a controlled murine system by isolating variables such as diet, treatment history, and housing co-inhabitants. Human microbiotas were remarkably resilient and recovered during antibiotic treatment, with transient dominance of resistant Bacteroides and taxa-asymmetric diversity reduction. In certain cases, in vitro sensitivities were not predictive of in vivo responses, underscoring the significance of host and community context. A fiber-deficient diet exacerbated microbiota collapse and delayed recovery. Species replacement through cross housing after ciprofloxacin treatment established resilience to a second treatment. Single housing drastically disrupted recovery, highlighting the importance of environmental reservoirs. Our findings highlight deterministic microbiota adaptations to perturbations and the translational potential for modulating diet, sanitation, and microbiota composition during antibiotics.},

  abstract = {A complex fluid submitted to strong flows can endure irreversible changes in its structure. This is the case for long chain polymer additives that are commonly used as viscosity enhancers in industry, notably for oil recovery. These polymers break in solution when submitted to high deformation rates, eventually causing a serious viscosity loss. This problem of practical importance is though difficult to handle from a fundamental point of view given its complexity. We introduce here a new tool, based on microfluidic technology, for the screening of the degradation of solutions in the model situation of the flow through a constriction. We integrate two functions in a single set-up, a micro-fabricated constriction and an onchip viscosimeter. This tool enables us to probe rapidly the viscosity loss imparted by flowing through the constriction at a given flow rate. Thanks to microfluidics, the sample preparation and measurement time are significantly lower than those implied by classical measurement protocols (reduction by up to two orders of magnitude). In addition, confinement provides control of the flow in terms of inertia. To illustrate the potential of this approach in a screening perspective, we use this tool to study the degradation of a series of semi-dilute aqueous solutions of PEO of varying molecular weights and concentrations. For each solution we identify a threshold flow rate for polymer degradation. The corresponding critical deformation rate decreases with molecular weight and concentration, as expected (the mass dependence is in line with previous reports and theories for dilute solutions). In addition we characterize the viscosity loss for larger deformation rates and find that, despite the polydispersity of our solutions, the observations for the various solutions can be roughly recast on a master curve by renormalization of the imposed deformation rates according to a law Mw-1.7{$\pm$}03c-0.7{$\pm$}03.},

  abstract = {As solids pyrolyse during combustion, they lose chemical and structural integrity by gradually degrading into residual char and forming defects such as voids, fissures and cracks. The material degradation process, which is coupled to the crack formation process, is described using a theoretical model and is numerically simulated using the finite-element method for a generic, charring, rubber-like material. In this model, a slab of material is subjected to an external, localized heat flux and, as the material degrades, cracks form when the local principal stress exceeds a defined cracking threshold. The magnitude of the cracking threshold               {$\sigma$}                                c                              is systematically varied in order to examine its influences on crack initiation, evolution, distribution and behaviour over time. When               {$\sigma$}                                c                              exceeds the maximum principal stress for the entire process,               {$\sigma$}                                m                              , then no cracks are generated.

  abstract = {Tracer particles immersed in suspensions of biological microswimmers such as E. coli or C. reinhardtii display phenomena unseen in conventional equilibrium systems, including strongly enhanced diffusivity relative to the Brownian value and non-Gaussian displacement statistics. In dilute, three-dimensional suspensions, these phenomena have typically been explained by the hydrodynamic advection of point tracers by isolated microswimmers, while, at higher concentrations, correlations between pusher microswimmers such as E. coli can increase the effective diffusivity even further. Anisotropic tracers in active suspensions can be expected to exhibit even more complex behavior than spherical ones due to the presence of a nontrivial translation-rotation coupling. Using large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by extended force dipoles, we study the motion of ellipsoidal point tracers immersed in three-dimensional microswimmer suspensions. We find that the rotational diffusivity of tracers is much less affected by swimmer-swimmer correlations than the translational diffusivity. We furthermore study the anisotropic translational diffusion in the particle frame and find that, in pusher suspensions, the diffusivity along the ellipsoid major axis is higher than in the direction perpendicular to it, albeit with a smaller ratio than for Brownian diffusion. Thus, we find that far-field hydrodynamics cannot account for the anomalous coupling between the translation and rotation observed in experiments, as was recently proposed. Finally, we study the probability distributions (PDFs) of translational and rotational displacements. In accordance with experimental observations, for short observation times we observe strongly non-Gaussian PDFs that collapse when rescaled with their variance, which we attribute to the ballistic nature of tracer motion at short times.},

  abstract = {The immense diversity of microbial life found in the vadose zone reflects the extremely heterogeneous and highly dynamic aquatic and chemical environments formed within soil pore spaces. The notion of planktonian free swimming microbes is unrealistic under most unsaturated conditions. Experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that surface attachment is the prevailing lifestyle, where bacterial colonies are embedded in biosynthesized extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This strategy represents a successful adaptation to the variable and unpredictable hydration conditions near the earth surface. The EPS matrix serves as the interface with the environment; it enhances hydration and transport properties in the immediate vicinity of microbial cells, and dampens effects of highly transient fluctuations in water and nutrient fluxes. The primary effect of soil pore geometry and hydration status is on diffusion pathways to and away from stationary microbial colonies. Microbial dependency on diffusion processes occurs at all scales, but is particularly important at the colony scale. We illustrate the critical role of diffusion pathways with their complex spatial and temporal patterns in promoting coexistence and diversity. We review specific features and adaptations of microbial life to the particular conditions of terrestrial soil environments. The physical and related chemical conditions that shape microbial habitats and govern key processes in unsaturated soils are reviewed in a quantitative framework. Key physiological adaptations and biological responses to challenges presented by unsaturated conditions are discussed. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of microbial activity on properties and characteristics of the host porous medium. This review is an attempt to establish an interdisciplinary dialogue between hydrologists and microbiologists towards a quantitative integration of the role of hydrologic conditions on microbial activity and the role of microbiology in controlling macroscopic fluxes within this important compartment of the biosphere.},

  abstract = {The buoyant motion of a bubble rising through a continuous liquid phase can be retarded by the adsorption onto the bubble surface of surfactant dissolved in the liquid phase. The reason for this retardation is that adsorbed surfactant is swept to the trailing pole of the bubble where it accumulates and lowers the surface tension relative to the front end. The difference in tension creates a Marangoni force which opposes the surface flow, rigidifies the interface and increases the drag coefficient. Surfactant molecules adsorb onto the bubble surface by diffusing from the bulk to the sublayer of liquid adjoining the surface, and kinetically adsorbing from the sublayer onto the surface. The surface surfactant distribution which defines the Marangoni force is determined by the rate of kinetic adsorption and bulk diffusion relative to the rate of surface convection. In the limit in which the rate of either kinetic or diffusive transport of surfactant to the bubble surface is slow relative to surface convection and surface diffusion is also slow, surfactant collects in a stagnant cap at the back end of the bubble while the front end is stress free and mobile. The size of the cap and correspondingly the drag coefficient increases with the bulk concentration of surfactant until the cap covers the entire surface and the drag coefficient is that of a bubble with a completely tangentially immobile surface. Previous theoretical research on the stagnant cap regime has not studied in detail the competing roles of bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption in determining the size of the stagnant cap angle, and there have been only a few studies which have attempted to quantitatively correlate simulations with measurements.This paper provides a more complete theoretical study of and a validating set of experiments on the stagnant cap regime. We solve numerically for the cap angle and drag coefficient as a function of the bulk concentration of surfactant for a spherical bubble rising steadily with inertia in a Newtonian fluid, including both bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption. For the case of diffusion-limited transport (infinite adsorption kinetics), we show clearly that very small bulk concentrations can immobilize the entire surface, and we calculate the critical concentrations which immobilize the surface as a function of the surfactant parameters. We demonstrate that the effect of kinetics is to reduce the cap angle (hence reduce the drag coefficient) for a given bulk concentration of surfactant. We also present experimental results on the drag of a bubble rising in a glycerol\textendash water mixture, as a function of the dissolved concentration of a polyethoxylated non-ionic surfactant whose bulk diffusion coefficient and a lower bound on the kinetic rate constants have been obtained separately by measuring the reduction in dynamic tension as surfactant adsorbs onto a clean interface. For low concentrations of surfactant, the experiments measure drag coefficients which are intermediate between the drag coefficient of a bubble whose surface is tangentially mobile and one whose surface is completely immobilized. Using the separately obtained value for the diffusion coefficient of the polyethoxylate, we undertake simulations which provide, upon comparison with the measured drag coefficients, a tighter bound on the kinetic rate constants than were otherwise obtained using dynamic surface tension measurement, and this suggests a new method for the measurement of kinetic rate constants.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to represent a given 2D shape with an automatically determined number of ellipses, so that the total area covered by the ellipses is equal to the area of the original shape without any assumption or prior knowledge about the object structure. To solve this interesting theoretical problem, first we employ the skeleton of the 2D shape which provides important information on the parameters of the ellipses that could approximate the original shape. For a given number of such ellipses, the hard ExpectationMaximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to maximise the shape coverage under the Equal Area constraint. Different models (i.e., solutions involving different numbers of ellipses) are evaluated based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This considers a novel, entropy-based shape complexity measure that balances the model complexity and the model approximation error. In order to minimise the AIC criterion, two variants are proposed and evaluated: (a) the augmentative method that gradually increases the number of considered ellipses starting from a single one and (b) the decremental method that decreases the number of ellipses starting from a large, automatically defined set. The obtained quantitative results on more than 4000 2D shapes included in standard as well as in custom datasets, quantify the performance of the proposed methods and illustrate that their solutions agree with human intuition. \& 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Diving provides opportunities for animals to find prey and escape from predators and is a source of great excitement for humans. However, diving from high platforms can cause severe injuries to a diver. In this study, we demonstrate how similarity in the morphology of diving fronts unifies the slamming force across diving animals and humans. By measuring a time-averaged impulse that increases linearly with the impact height, we are able to estimate the unsteady hydrodynamic forces that an average human body experiences during the slamming phase of a feet-first, hand-first, or head-first dive. We evaluate whether the unsteady forces put the diver at risk of muscle or bone injuries for a particular diving height. Therefore, this study sheds light on a hydrodynamics-based protocol for safe high diving and an evolutionary driver for animal morphology.           ,              This study investigates how humans and animals are injured due to diving.},

The model's generic simplicity allows us to quantify the observed enhanced Gaussian or non-Gaussian diffusion in an active bath.           ,              Particles kicked by external forces to produce mobility distinct from thermal diffusion are an iconic feature of the active matter problem. Here, we map this onto a minimal model for experiment and theory covering the wide time and length scales of usual active matter systems. A particle diffusing in a harmonic potential generated by an optical trap is kicked by programmed forces with time correlation at random intervals following the Poisson process. The model's generic simplicity allows us to find conditions for which displacements are Gaussian (or not), how diffusion is perturbed (or not) by kicks, and quantifying heat dissipation to maintain the non-equilibrium steady state in an active bath. The model reproduces experimental results of tracer mobility in an active bath of swimming algal cells. It can be used as a stochastic dynamic simulator for Brownian objects in various active baths without mechanistic understanding, owing to the generic framework of the protocol.},

Here, we experimentally investigate the run-and-tumble dynamics of the bacterium E. coli in polymeric solutions. We find that even small amounts of polymer in solution can drastically change E. coli dynamics: cells tumble less and their velocity increases, leading to an enhancement in cell translational diffusion and a sharp decline in rotational diffusion. We show that suppression of tumbling is due to fluid viscosity while the enhancement in swimming speed is mainly due to fluid elasticity. Visualization of single fluorescently labeled DNA polymers reveals that the flow generated by individual E. coli is sufficiently strong to stretch polymer molecules and induce elastic stresses in the fluid, which in turn can act on the cell in such a way to enhance its transport. Our results show that the transport and spread of chemotactic cells can be independently modified and controlled by the fluid material properties.},

Using particles covering a range of sizes from 0.6 to 39 microns, we probe particle dynamics at both short and long time scales. In all cases, the particles exhibit super-diffusive ballistic behavior at short times before eventually transitioning to diffusive behavior. Surprisingly, we find a regime in which larger particles can diffuse faster than smaller particles: the particle long-time effective diffusivity exhibits a peak in particle size, which is a deviation from classical thermal diffusion. We also find that the active contribution to particle diffusion is controlled by a dimensionless parameter, the P\'eclet number. A minimal model qualitatively explains the existence of the effective diffusivity peak and its dependence on bacterial concentration. Our results have broad implications on characterizing active fluids using concepts drawn from classical thermodynamics.},

A phase diagram of the flow of 3D               Escherichia coli               suspensions spanned by bacterial concentration, the swimming speed of bacteria, and the number fraction of active swimmers is systematically mapped, which shows quantitative agreement with kinetic theories and demonstrates the dominant role of hydrodynamic interactions in bacterial collective swimming. We trigger bacterial turbulence by suddenly increasing the swimming speed of light-powered bacteria and image the transition to the turbulence in real time. Our experiments identify two unusual kinetic pathways, i.e., the one-step transition with long incubation periods near the phase boundary and the two-step transition driven by long-wavelength instabilities deep inside the turbulent phase. Our study provides not only a quantitative verification of existing theories but also insights into interparticle interactions and transition kinetics of bacterial turbulence.},

  abstract = {Natural aquatic environments such as oceans, lakes, and rivers are home to a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Some may cross the air-water interface within droplets and become airborne, with the potential to impact the Earth's radiation budget, precipitation processes, and spread of disease. Larger droplets are likely to return to the water or adjacent land, but smaller droplets may be suspended in the atmosphere for transport over long distances. Here, we report on a series of controlled laboratory experiments to quantify wind-driven droplet production from a freshwater source for low wind speeds. The rate of droplet production increased quadratically with wind speed above a critical value (10-m equivalent 5.7 m/s) where droplet production initiated. Droplet diameter and ejection speeds were fit by a gamma distribution. The droplet mass flux and momentum flux increased with wind speed. Two mechanisms of droplet production, bubble bursting and fragmentation, yielded different distributions for diameter, speed, and angle. At a wind speed of about 3.5 m/s, aqueous suspensions of the ice-nucleating bacterium               Pseudomonas syringae               were collected at rates of 283~cells~m               -2               ~s               -1               at 5~cm above the water surface, and at 14~cells~m               -2               ~s               -1               at 10 cm above the water surface. At a wind speed of about 4.0 m/s, aqueous suspensions of               P. syringae               were collected at rates of 509~cells~m               -2               ~s               -1               at 5~cm above the water surface, and at 81~cells~m               -2               ~s               -1               at 10 cm above the water surface. The potential for microbial flux into the atmosphere from aquatic environments was calculated using known concentrations of bacteria in natural freshwater systems. Up to 3.1 \texttimes ~10               4               ~cells~m               -2               ~s               -1               of water surface were estimated to leave the water in potentially suspended droplets (diameters {$<$}100 \textmu m). Understanding the sources and mechanisms for bacteria to aerosolize from freshwater aquatic sources may aid in designing management strategies for pathogenic bacteria, and could shed light on how bacteria are involved in mesoscale atmospheric processes.},

  abstract = {The hydrodynamics of a flagellated micro-organism is investigated when swimming close to a planar free-slip surface by means of numerical solutions of the Stokes equations obtained via a boundary element method. Depending on the initial conditions, the swimmer can either escape from the free-slip surface or collide with the boundary. Interestingly, the micro-organism does not exhibit a stable orbit. Independently of escape or attraction to the interface, close to a free-slip surface, the swimmer follows a counter-clockwise trajectory, in agreement with experimental findings (Di Leonardo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106 (3), 2011, 038101). The hydrodynamics is indeed modified by the free surface. In fact, when the same swimmer moves close to a no-slip wall, a set of initial conditions exists which result in stable orbits. Moreover, when moving close to a free-slip or a no-slip boundary, the swimmer assumes a different orientation with respect to its trajectory. Taken together, these results contribute to shed light on the hydrodynamical behaviour of micro-organisms close to liquid\textendash air interfaces which are relevant for the formation of interfacial biofilms of aerobic bacteria.},

The dynamics of these systems are better understood and controlled considering their interaction with the environment, which for realistic systems is often highly heterogeneous and disordered. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of spatial disorder can alter the long-term dynamics in a colloidal active matter system, making it switch between gathering and dispersal of individuals. At equilibrium, colloidal particles always gather at the bottom of any attractive potential; however, under non-equilibrium driving forces in a bacterial bath, the colloids disperse if disorder is added to the potential. The depth of the local roughness in the environment regulates the transition between gathering and dispersal of individuals in the active matter system, thus inspiring novel routes for controlling emerging behaviours far from equilibrium.},

Synthetic self-propelled particles have also become available recently, such as two-faced, or Janus, particles propelled by differential chemical reactions on their surfaces driving a self-phoretic motion. In these lectures, I give a pedagogical introduction to the physics of single-particle and collective properties of active colloids, focussing on self propulsion. I will compare and contrast phenomena in suspensions of `swimmers' with the behaviour of suspensions of passive particles, where only Brownian motion (discovered by Robert Brown in granules from the pollen of the wild flower Clarkia pulchella) is relevant. I will pay particular attention to issues that pertain to performing experiments using these active particle suspensions, such as how to characterise the suspension's swimming speed distribution, and include an appendix to guide physicists wanting to start culturing motile bacteria.},

Furthermore, we find another regime, where the rotating sphere levitates in the space between the electrodes.

  abstract = {Hypothesis Particle-laden fluid interfaces are the central component of many natural and engineering systems. Understanding the mechanical properties and improving the stability of such interfaces are of great practical importance. Janus particles, a special class of heterogeneous colloids, might be used as an effective surface-active agent to control the assembly and interfacial rheology of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Experiments Using a custom-built interfacial stress rheometer, we explore the effect of Janus particle additives on the interfacial rheology and microscopic structure of particle-laden fluid interfaces. Findings We find that the addition of a small amount of platinum-polystyrene (Pt-PS) Janus particles within a monolayer of PS colloids (1:40 number ratio) can lead to more than an order-of-magnitude increase in surface moduli with enhanced elasticity, which improves the stability of the interface. This drastic change in interfacial rheology is associated with the formation of local particle clusters surrounding each Janus particle. We further explain the origin of local particle clusters by considering the interparticle interactions at the interface. Our experiments reveal the effect of local particle structures on the macroscopic rheological behaviors of particle monolayers and demonstrate a new way to tune the microstructure and mechanical properties of particle-laden fluid interfaces.},

The swimming mode of wild-type E. coli is often idealized as a run-and-tumble sequence in which periods of swimming at a constant speed are randomly interrupted by a sudden change of direction at a very low speed. Using a tracking microscope, we follow cells for extended periods of time in Newtonian liquids of varying viscosity and find that the swimming behavior of a single cell can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including run and tumble and "slow random walk" in which the cells move at a relatively low speed. Although the characteristic swimming speed varies between individuals and in different polymer solutions, we find that the skewness of the speed distribution is solely a function of viscosity and can be used, in concert with the measured average swimming speed, to determine the effective running speed of each cell. We hypothesize that differences in the swimming behavior observed in solutions of different viscosity are due to changes in the flagellar bundling time, which increases as the viscosity rises, due to the lower rotation rate of the flagellar motor. A numerical simulation and the use of resistive force theory provide support for this hypothesis.},

We report on the behavior of wild-type and smooth-swimming E. coli in Newtonian, shear-thinning, and viscoelastic media, measuring their trajectories and swimming speed using a three-dimensional real-time tracking microscope. We conclude that the speed enhancement in Methocel solution at higher concentrations is due to shear thinning and an analytical model is used to support our experimental result. We argue that shear-induced normal stresses reduce wobbling behavior during cell swimming but do not significantly affect swimming speed. However, the normal stresses play an important role in decreasing the flagellar bundling time, which changes the swimming-speed distribution. A dimensionless number, the ``strangulation number'' (Str) is proposed and used to characterize this effect.},

Streamlining active matter is especially important at the microscale, where the viscous forces prevail over inertia and transport requires a non-reciprocal motion. Here we report that microscopic active droplets representing aqueous dispersions of swimming bacteria Bacillus subtilis become unidirectionally motile when placed in an inactive nematic liquid-crystal medium. Random motion of bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into a directional self-locomotion of the droplet by the polar director structure that the droplet creates in the surrounding nematic through anisotropic molecular interactions at its surface. Droplets without active swimmers show no net displacement. The trajectory of the active droplet can be predesigned by patterning the molecular orientation of the nematic. The effect demonstrates that broken spatial symmetry of the medium can be the reason for and the means to control directional microscale transport.},

  abstract = {Electrolytic bubbles have a profound impact on mass transport in the vicinity of electrodes, greatly influencing the electrolyzer efficiency and cell overpotential. However, high spatio-temporal resolution experimental measurements of concentration fields around electrolytic bubbles, are challenging. In this study, a succession of spatially-decoupled electrolytic bubbles are simulated. The bubbles grow, and departing from a hydrophobic cavity at the center of a ring microelectrode. The gas-liquid interface is modeled using a moving mesh topology. A geometric cutting protocol is developed to handle topology changes during bubble departure. The simulated bubbles show good agreement with the bubble growth dynamics observed in experiments. The bubbles in this spatially-decoupled system outgrow the region of electrolyte that is saturated with dissolved hydrogen. This leaves the apex of the bubble interfaces exposed to an undersaturated region of the electrolyte which leads to an outward flux of hydrogen gas. This is shown to limit the gas evolution efficiency of bubbles despite the fact that they grow at a constant volumetric rate. By analyzing the distribution of the flux of dissolved hydrogen along the bubble interface along with the development of dissolve hydrogen concentration profiles around the bubble, we show that the magnitude of the outward diffusive flux at the apex of the bubble decreases with increasing electrolysis current.},

We show that the persistence time, diffusion coefficient and average speed increase with the bacterial concentration inside the drop, but are largely independent of the droplet size. By measuring the turbulent-like motion of the bacteria inside the drop, we demonstrate that the mean velocity of the bacteria near the bottom of the drop, which is separated from a glass substrate by a thin lubrication oil film, is antiparallel to the instantaneous velocity of the drop. This suggests that the driving mechanism is a slippery rolling of the drop over the substrate, caused by the collective motion of the bacteria. Our results show that microscopic organisms can transfer useful mechanical energy to their confining environment, opening the way to the assembly of mesoscopic motors composed of microswimmers.},

Reis                 et al.                              (p.               1231               , published online 11 November; see the cover) have discovered that cats curl their tongues so that the top surface touches the water. Then, by lifting their tongues rapidly, a column of liquid grows by inertia until gravity induces its breakage and the cats close their jaws to capture the liquid. Lapping frequency is tuned to maximize the volume ingested, depending on the animal's mass; a relationship that holds as true for tabby cats as it does for lions.                        ,              Cats use fluid inertia to generate a liquid column that they catch in their mouths before gravity destroys it.           ,                             Animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints. Vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink; the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs. We show that the domestic cat (               Felis catus               ) laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that               Felis catus               exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth. This competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass. Measurements of lapping frequency across the family Felidae support this prediction, which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines.},

In many regions, growth in the most hazardous flood zones is outpacing growth in non-exposed zones by a large margin, particularly in East Asia, where high-hazard settlements have expanded 60\% faster than flood-safe settlements. These results provide systematic evidence of a divergence in the exposure of countries to flood hazards. Instead of adapting their exposure, many countries continue to actively amplify their exposure to increasingly frequent climatic shocks.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

In this work, we present a new optimal and robust nonlinear regression model capable of fitting the MSD function with different regimes corresponding to different time scales. The algorithm presented here achieves two major goals; a more accurate estimation of D as well as extracting information about the short time behavior. The algorithm fits the MSD to a continuous piece-wise function and predicts all the coefficients in the model including the breakpoints. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to find the breakpoints which separate different modes of motion. We tested our algorithm using numerical experiments, and our fits described the data remarkably well. In addition, we applied our algorithm to extract D for water based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The results of our fits are in good agreement with the experimentally reported values.},

  abstract = {Many environments on Earth experience nutrient limitation and as a result have nongrowing or very slowly growing bacterial populations. To better understand bacterial respiration under environmentally relevant conditions, the effect of nutrient limitation on respiration rates of heterotrophic bacteria was measured. The oxygen consumption and population density of batch cultures of Escherichia coli K-12, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 were tracked for up to 200 days. The oxygen consumption per CFU (QO2) declined by more than 2 orders of magnitude for all three strains as they transitioned from nutrient-abundant log-phase growth to the nutrient-limited early stationary phase. The large reduction in QO2 from growth to stationary phase suggests that nutrient availability is an important factor in considering environmental respiration rates. Following the death phase, during the long-term stationary phase (LTSP), QO2 values of the surviving population increased with time and more cells were respiring than formed colonies. Within the respiring population, a subpopulation of highly respiring cells increased in abundance with time. Apparently, as cells enter LTSP, there is a viable but not culturable population whose bulk community and per cell respiration rates are dynamic. This result has a bearing on how minimal energy requirements are met, especially in nutrient-limited environments. The minimal QO2 rates support the extension of Kleiber's law to the mass of a bacterium (100-fg range).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION             Understanding complex cellular processes requires investigating the underlying mechanisms within a spatiotemporal context. Although cellular processes are dynamic in nature, most studies in molecular cell biology are based on fixed specimens, for example, using immunocytochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques, in particular, the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its spectral variants, have facilitated the study of a wide range of dynamic processes by allowing nondestructive labeling of target structures in living cells. In addition, the tremendous improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of light microscopes now allow cellular processes to be analyzed in unprecedented detail. These state-of-the-art imaging technologies, however, provide a huge amount of digital image data. To cope with the enormous amount of image data and to extract reproducible as well as quantitative information, computer-based image analysis is required. In this article, we describe methods for computer-based analysis of multidimensional live cell microscopy images and their application to study the dynamics of cells and particles. First, we sketch a general workflow for quantitative analysis of live cell images. Then, we detail computational methods for automatic image analysis comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, registration, tracking, and classification. We conclude with a discussion of quantitative analysis and systems biology.},

Passive fluctuations (e.g., thermal fluctuations) are independent of the orientation of the particle. In contrast, active ones point parallel or perpendicular to the time dependent orientation of the particle. We derive analytical expressions for the speed and velocity probability density for a generic model of active Brownian particles, which yields an increased probability of low speeds in the presence of active fluctuations in comparison to the case of purely passive fluctuations. As a consequence, we predict sharply peaked Cartesian velocity probability densities at the origin. Finally, we show that such a behavior may also occur in non-Gaussian active fluctuations and discuss briefly correlations of the fluctuating stochastic forces.},

To perform these tasks, cells spatiotemporally coordinate the interactions of force-generating, ``active'' molecules that create and manipulate non-equilibrium structures and force fields that span up to millimeter length scales [1-3]. Experimental active matter systems of biological or synthetic molecules are capable of spontaneously organizing into structures [4, 5] and generating global flows [6-9]. However, these experimental systems lack the spatiotemporal control found in cells, limiting their utility for studying non-equilibrium phenomena and bioinspired engineering. Here, we uncover non-equilibrium phenomena and principles by optically controlling structures and fluid flow in an engineered system of active biomolecules. Our engineered system consists of purified microtubules and light-activatable motor proteins that crosslink and organize microtubules into distinct structures upon illumination. We develop basic operations, defined as sets of light patterns, to create, move, and merge microtubule structures. By composing these basic operations, we are able to create microtubule networks that span several hundred microns in length and contract at speeds up to an order of magnitude faster than the speed of an individual motor. We manipulate these contractile networks to generate and sculpt persistent fluid flows. The principles of boundary-mediated control we uncover may be used to study emergent cellular structures and forces and to develop programmable active matter devices.},

  abstract = {When thin films of colloidal fluids are dried, a range of transitions are observed and the final film profile is found to depend on the processes that occur during the drying step. This article describes the drying process, initially concentrating on the various transitions. Particles are seen to initially consolidate at the edge of a drying droplet, the so-called coffee-ring effect. Flow is seen to be from the centre of the drop towards the edge and a front of close-packed particles passes horizontally across the film. Just behind the particle front the now solid film often displays cracks and finally the film is observed to de-wet. These various transitions are explained, with particular reference to the capillary pressure which forms in the solidified region of the film. The reasons for cracking in thin films is explored as well as various methods to minimize its effect. Methods to obtain stratified coatings through a single application are considered for a one-dimensional drying problem and this is then extended to two-dimensional films. Different evaporative models are described, including the physical reason for enhanced evaporation at the edge of droplets. The various scenarios when evaporation is found to be uniform across a drying film are then explained. Finally different experimental techniques for examining the drying step are mentioned and the article ends with suggested areas that warrant further study.},

  abstract = {The study of collective motion in bacterial suspensions has been of significant recent interest. To better understand the non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations emerging in the course of collective swimming in suspensions of motile bacteria, a simple model is employed: a bacterium is represented as a force dipole with size, through the use of a short-range repelling potential, and shape. The model emphasizes two fundamental mechanisms: dipolar hydrodynamic interactions and short-range bacterial collisions. Using direct particle simulations validated by a dedicated experiment, we show that changing the swimming speed or concentration alters the time scale of sustained collective motion, consistent with experiment. Also, the correlation length in the collective state is almost constant as concentration and swimming speed change even though increasing each greatly increases the input of energy to the system. We demonstrate that the particle shape is critical for the onset of collective effects. In addition, new experimental results are presented illustrating the onset of collective motion with an ultrasound technique.},

  abstract = {A simple kinetic model is presented for the shear rheology of a dilute suspension of particles swimming at low Reynolds number. If interparticle hydrodynamic interactions are neglected, the configuration of the suspension is characterized by the particle orientation distribution, which satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation including the effects of the external shear flow, rotary diffusion, and particle tumbling. The orientation distribution then determines the leading-order term in the particle extra stress in the suspension, which can be evaluated based on the classic theory of Hinch and Leal (J Fluid Mech 52(4):683\textendash 712, 1972), and involves an additional contribution arising from the permanent force dipole exerted by the particles as they propel themselves through the fluid. Numerical solutions of the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation were obtained using a spectral method, and results are reported for the shear viscosity and normal stress difference coefficients in terms of flow strength, rotary diffusivity, and correlation time for tumbling. It is found that the rheology is characterized by much stronger normal stress differences than for passive suspensions, and that tailactuated swimmers result in a strong decrease in the effective shear viscosity of the fluid.},

A detailed model is proposed for a slender rod-like particle that propels itself in a viscous fluid by exerting a prescribed tangential stress on its surface, and a method is devised for the efficient calculation of hydrodynamic interactions in large-scale suspensions of such particles using slender-body theory and a smooth particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. Simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions for various system sizes and suspension volume fractions, and demonstrate a transition to large-scale correlated motions in suspensions of rear-actuated swimmers, or Pushers, above a critical volume fraction or system size. This transition, which is not observed in suspensions of head-actuated swimmers, or Pullers, is seen most clearly in particle velocity and passive tracer statistics. These observations are consistent with predictions from our previous mean-field kinetic theory, one of which states that instabilities will arise in uniform isotropic suspensions of Pushers when the product of the linear system size with the suspension volume fraction exceeds a given threshold. We also find that the collective dynamics of Pushers result in giant number fluctuations, local alignment of swimmers and strongly mixing flows. Suspensions of Pullers, which evince no large-scale dynamics, nonetheless display interesting deviations from the random isotropic state.},

By virtue of this internal energy conversion, these systems display unusual macroscopic rheological signatures, including a curious transition to an apparent superfluid-like state where internal activity exactly compensates viscous dissipation. These behaviors are unlike those of classical complex fluids and result from the coupling of particle configurations with both externally applied flows and internally generated fluid disturbances. Focusing on the well-studied example of a suspension of microswimmers, this review summarizes recent experiments, models, and simulations in this area and highlights the critical role played by the rheological response of these active materials in a multitude of phenomena, from the enhanced transport of passive suspended objects to the emergence of spontaneous flows and collective motion.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of a thin, axisymmetric, partially wetting drop as it evaporates. The effects of viscous dissipation, capillarity, slip, gravity, surface-tension gradients, and contact-angle hysteresis are taken into account in the regime in which the transport of vapour is dominated by diffusion. We find a criterion for when the contact-set radius close to extinction evolves as the square-root of the time remaining until extinction | the famous d2-law. However, for a sufficiently large rate of evaporation, our analysis predicts that a `d13=7-law' is more appropriate. We also determine how each of the physical effects in our model influences the evolution of the drop and hence its extinction time. Our asymptotic results are validated by comparison with numerical simulations. We then revisit our model for the vapour phase and take kinetic effects into account through a linear constitutive law that states that the mass flux through the drop surface is proportional to the difference between the vapour concentration in equilibrium and that at the interface. We perform a local analysis near the contact line to investigate the way in which kinetic effects regularize the mass-flux singularity at the contact line. The problem is further analysed via a matched asymptotic analysis in the physically relevant regime in which the kinetic timescale is much smaller than the diffusive one. We find that the effect of kinetics is limited to an inner region near the contact line, in which kinetic effects enter at leading order and cause the vapour concentration at the free surface to deviate from its equilibrium value. We also derive an explicit expression for the mass flux through the free surface of the drop.},

These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.,},

The technique has been applied to many areas of fluid mechanics and the accuracy and resolution has been greatly improved over the years. This was made possible by the creativity, enthusiasm and commitment of the developers, but also by the technical achievements in the field of tracer particles, light sources, recording systems, algorithms and computer power. Although time-resolved volumetric PIV measurements are possible today, the majority of measurements are still performed using planar PIV techniques for good reasons. First, planar PIV is rather simple to both install and use and the data is processed quickly and robustly. Second, in many cases planar PIV already provides the desired data to answer scientific questions. Due to the persistent interest in using planar PIV, it is the intention of this review to consider some classical operating rules from today's perspective and to prove their validity. This may seem needless at first glance. However, it should be noted that once a technique has been established, the basic aspects are generally taken for granted. Therefore, a critical look from time to time is advisable to check whether the concepts are still valid or whether changes are necessary. Furthermore, we intend to deduce under which conditions the use of more complicated techniques pays off.},

When dealing with active nanoparticles, however, the overwhelming presence of rotational diffusion hinders directed motion, leading to an increase of their effective temperature, but otherwise masking the effects of self-propulsion. Here, we demonstrate an experimental system where an active nanoparticle immersed in a critical solution and held in an optical harmonic potential features far-from-equilibrium behavior beyond an increase of its effective temperature. When increasing the laser power, we observe a cross-over from a Boltzmann distribution to a non-equilibrium state, where the particle performs fast orbital rotations about the beam axis. These findings are rationalized by solving the Fokker-Planck equation for the particle's position and orientation in terms of a moment expansion. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism results from the particle's non-sphericity and the lower critical point of the solution.},

This suggests the possibility to steer collective patterns by introducing and controlling defects in an active system. Here we show that a self-assembled, passive nematic is ideally suited to control the pattern formation process of an active fluid. To this end, we force microtubules to glide inside a passive nematic material made from actin filaments. The actin nematic features self-assembled half-integer defects that steer the active microtubules and lead to the formation of macroscopic polar patterns. Moreover, by confining the nematic in circular geometries, chiral loops form. We find that the exact positioning of nematic defects in the passive material deterministically controls the formation and the polarity of the active flow, opening the possibility of efficiently shaping an active material using passive defects.},

  abstract = {Combining experiments and numerical simulations with a mechanical-statistical model of twisted yarns, we discuss the spinning transition between a cohesionless assembly of fibers into a yarn. We show that this transition is continuous but very sharp due to a giant amplification of frictional forces which scales as exp\texttheta 2, where \texttheta{} is the twist angle. We demonstrate that this transition is controlled solely by a nondimensional number H involving twist, friction coefficient, and geometric lengths. A critical value of this number Hc{$\simeq$}30 can be linked to a locking of the fibers together as the tensile strength is reached. This critical value imposes that yarns must be very slender structures with a given pitch. It also induces the existence of an optimal yarn radius. Predictions of our theory are successfully compared to yarns made from natural cotton fibers.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

This poorly understood process confers cohesive strength to many geological and industrial materials. Here we observe evaporation-driven aggregation of natural and synthesized particulates, probe their stability under rewetting, and measure bonding strength using an atomic force microscope. Cohesion arises at a common length scale ({$\sim$}5 {$\mu$}m), where interparticle attractive forces exceed particle weight. In polydisperse mixtures, smaller particles condense within shrinking capillary bridges to build stabilizing ``solid bridges'' among larger grains. This dynamic repeats across scales, forming remarkably strong, hierarchical clusters, whose cohesion derives from grain size rather than mineralogy. These results may help toward understanding the strength and erodibility of natural soils, and other polydisperse particulates that experience transient hydrodynamic forces.},

  abstract = {The effective viscosity of a dilute emulsion of spherical drops containing a soluble surfactant is calculated under a linear creeping flow. It is assumed that convection of surfactant is small relative to diffusion, and thus the Peclet number, P e, is small. We calculate the effective viscosity of the emulsion to O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}), where {$\varphi$} is the small volume fraction of the dispersed drops and {$\mu$} is the viscosity of the surfactant-free suspending fluid. This O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}) contribution is a sensitive function of the bulk and interfacial surfactant transport. Specifically, soluble surfactant molecules diffuse from the bulk to the interface and then adsorb to the interface. The ratio of the time scale for bulk diffusion to the time scale for adsorption to the interface is quantified by a Damkohler number, Da. The adsorption of surfactant to the interface may cause a significant decrease in the bulk concentration, which is known as depletion. The impact of depletion is characterized by two parameters: h, which is a dimensionless depletion depth; and k, which is the ratio of the desorption time scale to the adsorption time scale. We analytically determine how the O(P e{$\varphi\mu$}) contribution to the effective viscosity depends on h, k, and Da. Surprisingly, for certain regimes in the h - k - Da parameter space, we predict the effective viscosity of the emulsion to be greater than Einstein's result for the viscosity of a suspension of rigid spheres. Large Marangoni stresses driven by convective transport of soluble surfactant molecules are responsible for this result.},

Surface tension gradient can also be caused by a spatially varying temperature field which, in the absence of gravity, is solely responsible for driving a large scale convective flow. NASA STDC-1 (Surface Tension Driven Convection) experiments performed on USML-1 Spacelab missions in 1992 were designed to study thermocapillary flows in microgravity. Since then these experiments have become a benchmark in thermocapillary studies in the absence of gravity. However, interpretation of results of the original STDC-1 experiments remains challenging due to the low resolution of the available data. Analysis of the velocity field in those experiments was limited to a single tracking method without systematic and comparative studies. In the present study, we utilize multiple state-of-the-art Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry tools to extract the flow field from NASA STDCE-1 videos and compare the experimental data to the numerical results from COMSOL Multiphysics\textregistered{} v5.6. Finally, we discuss how our findings of temperature-driven Marangoni flow in the microgravity setting can improve future experiments and analysis.},

We elaborate on the meaning of the non-Boltzmann-Gibbs stationary distributions that emerge as a consequence of the persistent motion of active particles. These stationary distributions are interpreted as a class of distributions in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics known as superstatistics. Our analysis provides an original insight on the link between the intrinsic nonequilibrium nature of active motion and the well-known concept of local equilibrium used in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and contributes to the understanding of the validity of the concept of effective temperature. Particular cases of interest, regarding specific trapping potentials used in other theoretical or experimental studies, are discussed. We point out as an unprecedented effect, the emergence of new modes of the stationary distribution as a consequence of the coupling of persistent motion in a trapping potential that varies highly enough with position.},

These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3\textendash 5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an `object' on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly~(A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

However, the ability to achieve structured flows and ordered disclinations is of particular importance in the design and control of active systems. By confining an active nematic fluid within a channel, we find a regular motion of disclinations, in conjunction with a well defined and dynamic vortex lattice. As pairs of moving disclinations travel through the channel, they continually exchange partners producing a dynamic ordered state, reminiscent of Ceilidh dancing. We anticipate that this biomimetic ability to self-assemble organised topological disclinations and dynamically structured flow fields in engineered geometries will pave the road towards establishing new active topological microfluidic devices.},

A mathematical model with a single fitting parameter (the time delay between surface and volume synthesis) is quantitatively consistent with our SA/V experimental observations. The model supports that this time delay is due to differential expression of volume and surface-related genes, and that the first division after dilution occurs at a tightly controlled SA/V. Our minimal model thus provides insight into the connections between bacterial growth rate and cell shape in dynamic environments.},

In our model, individual, planktonic bacteria adhere to a surface, proliferate, and undergo a collective transition to a biofilm phenotype. This model predicts a stochastic transition between a loosely attached, finite layer of bacteria near the surface and a growing biofilm. The transition is governed by two key parameters: the collective transition density relative to the carrying capacity and the immigration rate relative to the detachment rate. Biofilm initiation is complex, but our model suggests that stochastic nucleation phenomena may be relevant.},

  abstract = {Active matter exhibits various forms of non-equilibrium states in the absence of external forcing, including macroscopic steady-state currents. Such states are often too complex to be modelled from first principles and our understanding of their physics relies heavily on minimal models. These have mostly been studied in the case of "dry" active matter, where particle dynamics are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to "wet" active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modelled as self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of active systems. Their phenomenology is well-established: at sufficiently high density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial turbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used mean-field assumption, and explicitly takes into account such correlations. Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the mean-field behaviour is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming.},

To account phenomenologically for the presence of an active component driving the ambient fluid flow, we postulate a generic nonlocal extension of the stress-tensor, conceptually similar to those recently introduced in granular flows. Stability and spectral properties of the resulting hydrodynamic model are studied both analytically and numerically for the two-dimensional (2D) case with periodic boundary conditions. Future generalizations of this theory could be useful for quantifying the shear properties of active suspensions.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of biological image data generally involves the detection of many subresolution spots. Especially in live cell imaging, for which fluorescence microscopy is often used, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be extremely low, making automated spot detection a very challenging task. In the past, many methods have been proposed to perform this task, but a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of these methods is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the most frequently used detection methods for this purpose. These include seven unsupervised and two supervised methods. We perform experiments on synthetic images of three different types, for which the ground truth was available, as well as on real image data sets acquired for two different biological studies, for which we obtained expert manual annotations to compare with. The results from both types of experiments suggest that for very low SNRs ( 2), the supervised (machine learning) methods perform best overall. Of the unsupervised methods, the detectors based on the so-called -dome transform from mathematical morphology or the multiscale variance-stabilizing transform perform comparably, and have the advantage that they do not require a cumbersome learning stage. At high SNRs ( 5), the difference in performance of all considered detectors becomes negligible.},

  abstract = {A motile bacterium swims by generating flow in its surrounding liquid. Anisotropy of the suspending liquid significantly modifies the swimming dynamics and corresponding flow signatures of an individual bacterium and impacts collective behavior. We study the interactions between swimming bacteria in an anisotropic environment exemplified by lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal. Our analysis reveals a significant localization of the bacteria-induced flow along a line coaxial with the bacterial body, which is due to strong viscosity anisotropy of the liquid crystal. Despite the fact that the average viscosity of the liquid crystal is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of pure water, the speed of bacteria in the liquid crystal is of the same order of magnitude as in water. We show that bacteria can transport a cargo (a fluorescent particle) along a predetermined trajectory defined by the direction of molecular orientation of the liquid crystal. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic interaction between flagella of two close-by bacteria is negligible, the observed convergence of the swimming speeds as well as flagella waves' phase velocities may occur due to viscoelastic interaction between the bacterial bodies.},

The porous medium was simulated by enclosing, between slide and cover slip, a bacterial-culture sample mixed with uniform 2.98-{$\mu$}m-diameter spherical latex particles. The porosity of the medium was controlled by changing the latex particle concentration. By statistically analyzing several trajectory parameters (instantaneous velocity, turn angle, mean squared displacement, etc.), and contrasting with the results of a random-walk model developed ad hoc, we were able to quantify the effects that different obstacle concentrations have upon bacterial motility.},

In passive microrheology, particles are forced by thermal fluctuations and probe linear viscoelasticity, whereas active microrheology involves forcing probes externally and can be extended out of equilibrium to the nonlinear regime. Here we review the development, present state, and future directions of this field. We organize our review around the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation (GSER), which plays a central role in the interpretation of microrheology. By discussing the Stokes and Einstein components of the GSER individually, we identify the key assumptions that underpin each, and the consequences that occur when they are violated. We conclude with a discussion of two techniques\textemdash multiple particle-tracking and nonlinear microrheology\textemdash that have arisen to handle systems in which the GSER breaks down.},

  abstract = {It is widely appreciated that surface tension can dominate the behavior of liquids at small scales. Solids also have surface stresses of a similar magnitude, but they are usually overlooked. However, recent work has shown that these can play a central role in the mechanics of soft solids such as gels. Here, we review this emerging field. We outline the theory of surface stresses, from both mechanical and thermodynamic perspectives, emphasizing the relationship between surface stress and surface energy. We describe a wide range of phenomena at interfaces and contact lines where surface stresses play an important role. We highlight how surface stresses cause dramatic departures from classic theories for wetting (Young\textendash Dupr\'e), adhesion (Johnson\textendash Kendall\textendash Roberts), and composites (Eshelby). A common thread is the importance of the ratio of surface stress to an elastic modulus, which defines a length scale below which surface stresses can dominate.},

  abstract = {, The effects of viscoelasticity have been shown to manifest themselves via symmetry breaking. In this investigation, we show a novel phenomenon that arises from this idea. We observe that when a dense sphere is rotated near a wall (the rotation being aligned with the wall-normal direction and gravity), it levitates to a fixed distance away from the wall. Since the shear is larger in the gap (between the sphere and the wall) than in the open side of the sphere, the shear-induced elastic stresses are thus asymmetric, resulting in a net elastic vertical force that balances the weight of the sphere. We conduct experiments, theoretical models and numerical simulations for rotating spheres of various sizes and densities in a Boger-type fluid. In the small-Deborah-number range, the results are collapsed into a universal trend by considering a dimensionless group of the ratio of elastic to gravitational forces.},

  abstract = {We examine the stability of a suspension of swimming bacteria in a Newtonian medium. The bacteria execute a run-and-tumble motion, runs being periods when a bacterium on average swims in a given direction; runs are interrupted by tumbles, leading to an abrupt, albeit correlated, change in the swimming direction. An instability is predicted to occur in a suspension of `pushers' (e.g.               E. Coli               ,               Bacillus subtilis               , etc.), and owes its origin to the intrinsic force dipoles of such bacteria. Unlike the dipole induced in an inextensible fibre subject to an axial straining flow, the forces constituting the dipole of a pusher are directed outward along its axis. As a result, the anisotropy in the orientation distribution of bacteria due to an imposed velocity perturbation drives a disturbance velocity field that acts to reinforce the perturbation. For long wavelengths, the resulting destabilizing bacterial stress is Newtonian but with a negative viscosity. The suspension becomes unstable when the total viscosity becomes negative. In the dilute limit (               nL               3               {$\ll$} 1), a linear stability analysis gives the threshold concentration for instability as (               nL               3               )                                crit                              = ((30/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ))(                                D                 r                              L               /               U               )(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              )))/(1-(15{$\mathscr{G}$}(               r               )/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ))(                                D                 r                              L               /               U               )(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              ))) for perfectly random tumbles; here,               L               and               U               are the length and swimming velocity of a bacterium,               n               is the bacterial number density,                                D                 r                              characterizes the rotary diffusion during a run and {$\tau$}               -1               is the average tumbling frequency.

Coli               ,               C               {$\approx$} 0.57. The threshold concentration diverges in the limit ((15{$\mathscr{G}$}(               r               )/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               )) (                                D                 r                              L               /               U               )(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              ))) \textrightarrow{} 1. This limit defines a critical swimming speed,                                U                 crit                              = (                                D                 r                              L               )(15{$\mathscr{G}$}(               r               )/               C               {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ))(1 + 1/(6{$\tau$}                                D                 r                              )). For speeds smaller than this critical value, the destabilizing bacterial stress remains subdominant and a dilute suspension of these swimmers therefore responds to long-wavelength perturbations in a manner similar to a suspension of passive rigid particles, that is, with a net enhancement in viscosity proportional to the bacterial concentration.                                         On the other hand, the stability analysis predicts that the above threshold concentration reduces to zero in the limit                                D                 r                              \textrightarrow{} 0, {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}, and a suspension of non-interacting straight swimmers is therefore always unstable. It is then argued that the dominant effect of hydrodynamic interactions in a dilute suspension of such swimmers is via an interaction-driven orientation decorrelation mechanism. The latter arises from uncorrelated pair interactions in the limit               nL               3               {$\ll$} 1, and for slender bacteria in particular, it takes the form of a hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity (                                D                 h                 r                              ); for               E. Coli               , we find                                D                 h                 r                              = 9.4 \texttimes{} 10               -5               (               nUL               2               ). From the above expression for the threshold concentration, it may be shown that even a weakly interacting suspension of slender smooth-swimming bacteria (               r               {$\gg$} 1, {$\mathscr{F}$}(               r               ) {$\approx$} 1, {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}) will be stable provided                                D                 h                 r                              {$>$} (               C               /30)(               nUL               2               ) in the limit               nL               3               {$\ll$} 1. The hydrodynamic rotary diffusivity of               E. Coli               is, however, too small to stabilize a dilute suspension of these swimmers, and a weakly interacting suspension of               E. Coli               remains unstable.},

In this review, we discuss recent experimental and computational studies that have revealed key molecular factors and interactions that give rise to the spatial organization, limited diffusivity, and stress-bearing capacity of the OM. These physical properties suggest broad connections between cellular structure and physiology, and we explore future prospects for further elucidation of the implications of OM construction on cellular fitness and survival.},

  abstract = {Flooded-bed scrubbers are commonly employed in continuous miners to capture and remove dust particles at the cutting face in underground coal mines. To date, the mechanism of filter clogging as well as the evolution of pressure drop has not been well understood. In this work, clogging of filters in a relevant flooded-bed scrubber environment have been investigated in a laboratory setting by spraying a slurry onto a filter assembly while pulling the air through. Two types of filters have been investigated, including a) a multi-layer mesh filter and 2) a fibrous woven filter. Results showed that the differential pressure (or pressure drop) increased with an accu\- mulation of clogged particles within the filter. The timed evolution of the pressure drop varied with both pore size and pore structure of the filter medium. When dust particles were much smaller than the pore size of the filter, dust particles predominantly accumulated inside the filter pack. When dust particles had comparable or larger sizes compared with the pore (or mesh) size of the filter medium, the filter was dominantly clogged at its front layers. Experimental results were compared with a modified model to account for the development of the pressure drop across the filter. The clogging of scrubber filters may be presented in two mechanisms, namely a) internal clogging and b) caking. The present result demonstrates the fundamental mechanism of clogging of dust particles within fibrous and mesh filters during dust capture and removal by flooded-bed wet scrubbers as well as other engineering applications involving in multi-phase interaction within a porous medium.},

The swimmers' motion is characterized by a mean drift velocity and an effective translational diffusivity that becomes anisotropic in the presence of the orienting field. Since the diffusivity yields information about the micromechanical stress, the anisotropy generated by the external field creates a normal stress difference in the recently developed ``swim stress'' tensor [Takatori, Yan, and Brady,               Phys. Rev. Lett.               , 2014]. This property can be exploited in the design of soft, compressible materials in which their size, shape, and motion can be manipulated and tuned by loading the material with active swimmers. Since the swimmers exert different normal stresses in different directions, the material can compress/expand, elongate, and translate depending on the external field strength. Such an active system can be used as nano/micromechanical devices and motors. Analytical solutions are corroborated by Brownian dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Confinement of living microorganisms and self-propelled particles by an external trap provides a means of analysing the motion and behaviour of active systems. Developing a tweezer with a trapping radius large compared with the swimmers' size and run length has been an experimental challenge, as standard optical traps are too weak. Here we report the novel use of an acoustic tweezer to confine self-propelled particles in two dimensions over distances large compared with the swimmers' run length. We develop a near-harmonic trap to demonstrate the crossover from weak confinement, where the probability density is Boltzmann-like, to strong confinement, where the density is peaked along the perimeter. At high concentrations the swimmers crystallize into a close-packed structure, which subsequently `explodes' as a travelling wave when the tweezer is turned off. The swimmers' confined motion provides a measurement of the swim pressure, a unique mechanical pressure exerted by self-propelled bodies.},

Whereas the evaporation of pure liquids, liquids with dispersed particles, or even liquid mixtures has intensively been studied over the past two decades, the evaporation of ternary mixtures of liquids with different volatilities and mutual solubilities has not yet been explored. Here we show that the evaporation of such ternary mixtures can trigger a phase transition and the nucleation of microdroplets of one of the components of the mixture. As a model system, we pick a sessile Ouzo droplet (as known from daily life\textemdash a transparent mixture of water, ethanol, and anise oil) and reveal and theoretically explain its four life phases: In phase I, the spherical cap-shaped droplet remains transparent while the more volatile ethanol is evaporating, preferentially at the rim of the drop because of the singularity there. This leads to a local ethanol concentration reduction and correspondingly to oil droplet nucleation there. This is the beginning of phase II, in which oil microdroplets quickly nucleate in the whole drop, leading to its milky color that typifies the so-called ``Ouzo effect.'' Once all ethanol has evaporated, the drop, which now has a characteristic nonspherical cap shape, has become clear again, with a water drop sitting on an oil ring (phase III), finalizing the phase inversion. Finally, in phase IV, all water has evaporated, leaving behind a tiny spherical cap-shaped oil drop.},

  abstract = {This review is devoted to the simple process of drying a multicomponent droplet of a complex fluid which may contain salt or other inclusions. These processes provide a fascinating subject for study. The explanation of the rich variety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge but also a problem of practical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and improvement of coating/printing technology. The fundamental scientific problem is the study of the mechanism of micro- and nanoparticle self-organization in open systems. The specific fundamental problems to be solved, related to this system, are the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and evolution of phase fronts, and the identification of mechanisms of pattern formation. The drops of liquid containing dissolved substances and suspended particles are assumed to be drying on a horizontal solid insoluble smooth substrate. The chemical composition and macroscopic properties of the complex fluid, the concentration and nature of the salt, the surface energy of the substrate, and the interaction between the fluid and substrate which determines the wetting all affect the final morphology of the dried film. The range of our study encompasses the fully wetting case with zero contact angle between the fluid and substrate to the case where the drop is levitated in space, so there is no contact with a substrate and angle of contact can be considered as 180\textdegree.},

  abstract = {Evaporation-induced particle deposition patterns like coffee rings provide easy visual identification that is beneficial for developing inexpensive and simple diagnostic devices for detecting pathogens. In this study, the effect of chemotaxis on such pattern formation has been realized experimentally in drying droplets of bacterial suspensions. We have investigated the velocity field, concentration profile, and deposition pattern in the evaporating droplet of Escherichia coli suspension in the presence and absence of nutrients. Flow visualization experiments using particle image velocimetry (PIV) were carried out with E. coli bacteria as biological tracer particles. Experiments were conducted for suspensions of motile (live) as well as nonmotile (dead) bacteria. In the absence of any nutrient gradient like sugar on the substrate, both types of bacterial suspension showed two symmetric convection cells and a ring like deposition of particles after complete evaporation. Interestingly, the droplet containing live bacterial suspension showed a different velocity field when the sugar was placed at the base of the droplet. This can be attributed to the chemoattractant nature of the sugar, which induced chemotaxis among live bacteria targeted toward the nutrient site. Deposition of the suspended bacteria was also displaced toward the nutrient site as the evaporation proceeded. Our experiments demonstrate that both velocity fields and concentration patterns can be altered by chemotaxis to modify the pattern formation in evaporating droplet containing live bacteria. These results highlight the role of bacterial chemotaxis in modifying coffee ring patterns.},

Through shear stress generation and molecular transport regulation, hydrodynamics conveys effects that are very different by nature but strongly coupled. To decipher the influence of these levers on bacterial biofilms immersed in moving fluids, we quantitatively and simultaneously investigated physicochemical and biological properties of the biofilm. We designed a millifluidic setup allowing to control hydrodynamic conditions and to monitor biofilm development in real time using microscope imaging. We also conducted a transcriptomic analysis to detect a potential physiological response to hydrodynamics. We discovered that a threshold value of shear stress determined biofilm settlement, with sub-piconewton forces sufficient to prevent biofilm initiation. As a consequence, distinct hydrodynamic conditions, which set spatial distribution of shear stress, promoted distinct colonization patterns with consequences on the growth mode. However, no direct impact of mechanical forces on biofilm growth rate was observed. Consistently, no mechanosensing gene emerged from our differential transcriptomic analysis comparing distinct hydrodynamic conditions. Instead, we found that hydrodynamic molecular transport crucially impacts biofilm growth by controlling oxygen availability. Our results shed light on biofilm response to hydrodynamics and open new avenues to achieve informed design of fluidic setups for investigating, engineering or fighting adherent communities.},

However, if there is relative horizontal motion between the jet and the bath, we found that the jet can bounce.1 In these images, a jet of silicone oil of flow rate Q and viscosity {$\mu$} is falling from height H to a bath of the same liquid, which is moving to the right with velocity Vbath. Figure 1 is a time sequence of a jet spontaneously starting to bounce during a rapid decrease in the jet's flow rate. The images show both above and below the surface; the surface is a dark, horizontal line. Before the jet begins to bounce, it entrains a thin, cylindrical film of air into the bath. As the flow rate decreases, the length of the cylindrical film decreases until the jet bounces; the jet and bath are separated by a lubricating layer of air. Figure 2 shows that the rebound is nearly vertical at small bath velocities and becomes more oblique with larger bath velocities. Figure 3 displays a jet bouncing twice. The bouncing phenomenon was observed over a broad range of viscosity, jet velocity, jet radius, and bath velocity. This experiment can easily be done at home by pouring mineral oil into a pan of mineral oil.1},

  abstract = {Active particles, including swimming microorganisms, autophoretic colloids, and droplets, are known to self-organize into ordered structures at fluid\textendash solid boundaries. The entrainment of particles in the attractive parts of their spontaneous flows has been postulated as a possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Here, combining experiments, theory, and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the validity of this flow-induced ordering mechanism in a suspension of active emulsion droplets. We show that the mechanism can be controlled, with a variety of resultant ordered structures, by simply altering hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Thus, for flow in Hele\textendash Shaw cells, metastable lines or stable traveling bands can be obtained by varying the cell height. Similarly, for flow bounded by a plane, dynamic crystallites are formed. At a no-slip wall, the crystallites are characterized by a continuous out-of-plane flux of particles that circulate and re-enter at the crystallite edges, thereby stabilizing them. At an interface where the tangential stress vanishes, the crystallites are strictly 2D, with no out-of-plane flux. We rationalize these experimental results by calculating, in each case, the slow viscous flow produced by the droplets and the long-ranged, many-body active forces and torques between them. The results of numerical simulations of motion under the action of the active forces and torques are in excellent agreement with experiments. Our work elucidates the mechanism of flow-induced phase separation in active fluids, particularly active colloidal suspensions, and demonstrates its control by boundaries, suggesting routes to geometric and topological phenomena in an active matter.},

  abstract = {We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools.},

The filaments can exist in different polymorphic forms, having distinct values of curvature and twist. Rotation rates are on the order of 100 Hz. In the past, the motion of individual filaments has been visualized by dark-field or differential-interference-contrast microscopy, methods hampered by intense scattering from the cell body or shallow depth of field, respectively. We have found a simple procedure for fluorescently labeling cells and filaments that allows recording their motion in real time with an inexpensive video camera and an ordinary fluorescence microscope with mercury-arc or strobed laser illumination. We report our initial findings with cells of               Escherichia coli               . Tumbles (events that enable swimming cells to alter course) are remarkably varied. Not every filament on a cell needs to change its direction of rotation: different filaments can change directions at different times, and a tumble can result from the change in direction of only one. Polymorphic transformations tend to occur in the sequence normal, semicoiled, curly 1, with changes in the direction of movement of the cell body correlated with transformations to the semicoiled form.},

We provide an experimental approach and theoretical framework for measuring the mechanical properties of live bacteria. We encapsulated bacteria in agarose with a user-defined stiffness, measured the growth rate of individual cells, and fit data to a thin-shell mechanical model to extract the effective longitudinal Young's modulus of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli (50\textendash 150 MPa), Bacillus subtilis (100\textendash 200 MPa), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100\textendash 200 MPa). Our data provide estimates of cell wall stiffness similar to values obtained via the more labor-intensive technique of atomic force microscopy. To address physiological perturbations that produce changes in cellular mechanical properties, we tested the effect of A22-induced MreB depolymerization on the stiffness of E. coli. The effective longitudinal Young's modulus was not significantly affected by A22 treatment at short time scales, supporting a model in which the interactions between MreB and the cell wall persist on the same time scale as growth. Our technique therefore enables the rapid determination of how changes in genotype and biochemistry affect the mechanical properties of the bacterial envelope.},

Using the geometry of a sessile drop, we demonstrate in suspensions of Bacillus subtilis the self-organized generation of a persistent hydrodynamic vortex that traps cells near the contact line. Arising from upward oxygentaxis and downward gravitational forcing, these dynamics are related to the Boycott effect in sedimentation and are explained quantitatively by a mathematical model consisting of oxygen diffusion and consumption, chemotaxis, and viscous fluid dynamics. The vortex is shown to advectively enhance uptake of oxygen into the suspension, and the wedge geometry leads to a singularity in the chemotactic dynamics near the contact line.},

For s this gives the exact frequency distribution corresponding to the exact formula for s2 of Ornstein and F\"urth. Discussion is given of the connection with the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation. By the same method exact expressions are obtained for the square of the deviation of a harmonically bound particle in Brownian motion as a function of the time and the initial deviation. Here the periodic, aperiodic and overdamped cases have to be treated separately. In the last case, when {$\beta$} is much larger than the frequency and for values of t{$\gg\beta-$}1, the formula takes the form of that previously given by Smoluchowski.},

Using a variational method, we study both the transient and long-time behavior of defects in two-dimensional active polar fluids in the limit of strong order and overdamped, compressible flow, and compare the defect dynamics with the corresponding active nematics model studied recently. One result is non-central interactions between defect pairs for active polar fluids, and by extending our analysis to allow orientation dynamics of defects, we find that the orientation of +1 defects, unlike that of {$\pm$}1/2 defects in active nematics, is not locked to defect positions and relaxes to asters. Moreover, using a scaling argument, we explain the transient feature of active polar defects and show that in the steady state, active polar fluids are either devoid of defects or consist of a single aster. We argue that for contractile (extensile) active nematic systems, +1 vortices (asters) should emerge as bound states of a pair of +1/2 defects, which has been recently observed. Moreover, unlike the polar case, we show that for active nematics, a linear chain of equally spaced bound states of pairs of +1/2 defects can screen the activity term. A common feature in both models is the appearance of +1 defects (elementary in polar and composite in nematic) in the steady state.},

We compare and contrast this, only later discovered to be stored in the linear biomolecule DNA, with the information-bearing, layered quasi-one-dimensional materials investigated by the emerging field of               chaotic crystallography               . Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the information character of biotic and abiotic matter\textemdash a broadly applicable physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii) we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we recount recent investigations into the structure of tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene, showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from informational materials science may impact biology.},

Biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy and a major cause of persistent and recurrent infections by clinically important pathogens worldwide (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus). Currently, most biofilm remediation strategies involve the development of biofilm-inhibition agents, aimed at preventing the early stages of biofilm formation, or biofilm-dispersal agents, aimed at disrupting the biofilm cell community. While both strategies offer some clinical promise, neither represents a direct treatment and eradication strategy for established biofilms. Consequently, the discovery and development of biofilm eradication agents as comprehensive, stand-alone biofilm treatment options has become a fundamental area of research. Here we review our current understanding of biofilm antibiotic tolerance mechanisms and provide an overview of biofilm remediation strategies, focusing primarily on the most promising biofilm eradication agents and approaches. Many of these offer exciting prospects for the future of biofilm therapeutics for a large number of infections that are currently refractory to conventional antibiotics.},

  abstract = {We review the observations and the basic laws describing the essential aspects of collective motion \textemdash{} being one of the most common and spectacular manifestation of coordinated behavior. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

  abstract = {Diving induces large pressure during water entry accompanied by the creation of cavity and water splash ejected from the free water surface. To minimize impact forces, divers streamline their shape at impact. Here, we investigate the impact forces and splash evolution of wedges entering water as a function of the wedge opening angle. A gradual transition from impactful to smooth entry is observed as the wedge angle decreases. After submersion, the wedge experiences significantly smaller drag forces (two-fold smaller) than immersed wedges. Our experimental findings compare favourably with existing force models upon the introduction of empirically based corrections. We experimentally characterize the shapes of the cavity and splash created by the wedge and find that they are independent of the entry velocity at short times, but that the splash exhibits distinct variations in shape at later times. We propose a one-dimensional model of the splash that takes into account gravity, surface tension and aerodynamic forces. The model shows, in conjunction with experimental data, that the splash shape is dominated by the interplay between a destabilizing Venturi-suction force due to air rushing between the splash and the water surface and a stabilizing force due to surface tension. Taken together, these findings could direct future research aimed at understanding and combining the mechanisms underlying all stages of water entry in application to engineering and bio-related problems, including naval engineering, disease spreading or platform diving.},

Self-organization of active entities, leading to novel phases and emergent macroscopic properties, recently shed new light on these complex dynamical processes. Here we show that under the application of a constant magnetic field, motile magnetotactic bacteria confined in water-in-oil droplets self-assemble into a rotary motor exerting a torque on the external oil phase. A collective motion in the form of a large-scale vortex, reversable by inverting the field direction, builds~up in the droplet with a vorticity perpendicular to the magnetic field. We study this collective organization at different concentrations, magnetic fields and droplet radii and reveal the formation of two torque-generating areas close to the droplet interface. We characterize quantitatively the mechanical energy extractable from this new biological and self-assembled motor.},

Controversy between the different models has been aroused without elucidating the variations in chewing frequency. In the present study we show that vigorous chewing is limited by the maximum force of muscle, so that the upper chewing frequency scales as the -1/3 power of body mass for large animals and as a constant frequency for small animals. On the other hand, gentle chewing to mix food uniformly without excess of saliva describes the lower limit of chewing frequency, scaling approximately as the -1/6 power of body mass. These physical constraints frame the -1/4 power law classically inferred from allometry of animal metabolic rates. All of our experimental data stay within these physical boundaries over six orders of magnitude of body mass regardless of food types.},

With one single degree of freedom, the angle of a rotating bundle of flagella, bacteria provide one of the simplest examples of locomotion in the living world. Here we show that a purely physical mechanism, depending on a hydrodynamic stability condition, is responsible for a confinement induced transition between two swimming states in               E. coli               . While in large channels bacteria always crash onto confining walls, when the cross section falls below a threshold, they leave the walls to move swiftly on a stable swimming trajectory along the channel axis. We investigate this phenomenon for individual cells that are guided through a sequence of micro-fabricated tunnels of decreasing cross section. Our results challenge current theoretical predictions and suggest effective design principles for microrobots by showing that motility based on helical propellers provides a robust swimming strategy for exploring narrow spaces.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic particles are common in many industrial and natural turbulent flows. When these particles are small and neutrally buoyant, they follow Lagrangian trajectories while exhibiting rich orientational dynamics from the coupling of their rotation to the velocity gradients of the turbulence field. This system has proven to be a fascinating application of the fundamental properties of velocity gradients in turbulence. When particles are not neutrally buoyant, they experience preferential concentration and very different preferential alignment than neutrally buoyant tracer particles. A vast proportion of the parameter range of anisotropic particles in turbulence is still unexplored, with most existing research focusing on the simple foundational cases of axisymmetric ellipsoids at low concentrations in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and in turbulent channel flow. Numerical simulations and experiments have recently developed a fairly comprehensive picture of alignment and rotation in these cases, and they provide an essential foundation for addressing more complex problems of practical importance. Macroscopic effects of nonspherical particle dynamics include preferential concentration in coherent structures and drag reduction by fiber suspensions. We review the models used to describe nonspherical particle motion, along with numerical and experimental methods for measuring particle dynamics.},

We demonstrate that the reversal in propulsion direction changes the nature of the hydrodynamic interaction from attractive to repulsive and can drive the particle assemblies to undergo both fusion and fission transitions. Moreover, we show these active colloids can act as nucleation sites, and switch rapidly the interactions between active and passive particles, leading to reconfigurable assembly and disassembly. Our experiments are qualitatively described by a minimal hydrodynamic model.},

We describe the phenomenon of stable noncoalescence between two jets of the same fluid, colliding obliquely with each other. Using a simple experimental setup, we carry out a parametric study of the bouncing jets by varying the jet diameter, velocity, angle of inclination, and fluid viscosity, which suggests that the contact time of bouncing jets scales as the square root of the normal Weber number We. A dimensionless parameter K=(We{$\surd$}Re/sin {$\alpha$})1/2, where Re is the normal Reynolds number and {$\alpha$} the angle of inclination of the jets, quantitatively captures the transition of colliding jets from bouncing to coalescence. This parameter draws parallels between jet coalescence and droplet splashing and indicates that the transition is governed by a surface instability. Stable and continuous noncoalescence between fluid jets makes it a good platform for experimental studies of the interaction between fluid interfaces and the properties of the interfacial air films.},

The theory developed in this paper explains the phenomenon by applying the Griffith energy criteria to a poroelastic film of Hertzian spheres. Prior to delamination, flow due to drying compresses the film in the direction of flow and generates tension in the transverse direction. Delamination allows relaxation in both the transverse tensile stresses and the axial compression. Preliminary numerical solutions suggest that the elastic energy recovered should increase linearly with the length of the close-packed film. That suggests a simple analytical solution that predicts the advancing of the delamination as the length of the close-packed region increases and explains qualitatively the essential features of the phenomenon.},

With a constant interface velocity, thermodynamics drives the suspension behavior when Pe               U               {$\ll$} 1, and homogeneous crystallization appears when the gap spacing between the two boundaries pushes the volume fraction above the equilibrium phase boundary. In contrast, when Pe               U               {$\gg$} 1, local epitaxial crystal growth appears adjacent to the moving interface even for large gap sizes. Interestingly, the most amorphous film microstructures are found at moderate Pe               U               . The film stress profile develops sharp transitions and becomes step-like with growing P\'eclet number. With a constant imposed stress, the interface stops moving as the suspension pressure increases and the microstructural and mechanical behaviors are similar to the constant velocity case. Comparison with the simulations shows that the model accurately captures the stress on the moving interface, and quantitatively resolves the local stress and volume fraction distributions for low to moderate P\'eclet numbers. This work demonstrates the critical role of interface motion on the film microstructures and stresses.},

  abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and poor immunogenicity are two of the challenges that cancer immunotherapies have to overcome for improved clinical benefits. Among various immunosuppressive metabolites that keep anti-tumor immunity in check, the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine (Kyn) is an attractive target for blockade given its role in mediating immunosuppression through multiple pathways. Here, we present a local chemo-immunometabolic therapy through injection of a supramolecular hydrogel concurrently releasing doxorubicin that induces immunogenic tumor cell death and kynureninase that disrupts Kyn-mediated immunosuppressive pathways in TME. The combination synergically enhances tumor immunogenicity and unleashes anti-tumor immunity. In mouse models of triple negative breast cancer and melanoma, a single low dose peritumoral injection of the therapeutic hydrogel promotes TME transformation toward more immunostimulatory, which leads to enhanced tumor suppression and extended mouse survival. In addition, the systemic anti-tumor surveillance induced by the local treatment exhibits an abscopal effect and prevents tumor relapse post-resection. This versatile approach for local chemo-immunometabolic therapy may serve as a general strategy for enhancing anti-tumor immunity and boosting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies., Tryptophan metabolism, leading to the accumulation of kynurenine (Kyn) in the tumor microenvironment, restricts anti-tumor immunity. Here the authors report the design of a hydrogel loaded with doxorubicin and Kyn-degrading kynureninase to relieve immunosuppression, showing anti-tumor responses in preclinical models.},

We show that calculation of Cy across a range of discretizations can distinguish the effects of localization error, confinement, and medium elasticity. Thus, under certain regimes, Cy can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify the underlying mechanism of anomalous diffusion. Finally, we apply our analysis to experimental data sets of chromosomal loci and RNA-protein particles in Escherichia coli.},

  abstract = {To swim, a bacterium pushes against the fluid within which it is immersed, generating fluid flow that dies off on a length scale comparable to the size of the bacterium. However, in dense colonies of bacteria, the bacteria are close enough that flow generated by swimming is substantial. For these cases, complex flows can arise due to the interaction and feedback between the bacteria and the fluid. Recent experiments on dense populations of swimming Bacillus subtilis have revealed a volume fractiondependent transition from random swimming to transient jet and vortex patterns in the bacteria/fluid mixture. The fluid motions that are observed are reminiscent of flows that are observed around translating objects at moderate to high Reynolds numbers. In this work, I present a two-phase model for the bacterial/fluid mixture. The model explains turbulent flows in terms of the dipole stress that the bacteria exert on the fluid, entropic elasticity due to the rod shape of each bacterium, and the torque on the bacteria due to fluid gradients. Solving the equations in two dimensions using realistic parameters, the model reproduces empirically observed velocity fields. Dimensional analysis provides scaling relations for the dependence of the characteristic scales on the model parameters.},

Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the self-organization principles that govern flow statistics in such nonequilibrium networks. Here we connect concepts from lattice field theory, graph theory, and transition rate theory to understand how topology controls dynamics in a generic model for actively driven flow on a network. Our combined theoretical and numerical analysis identifies symmetry-based rules that make it possible to classify and predict the selection statistics of complex flow cycles from the network topology. The conceptual framework developed here is applicable to a broad class of biological and nonbiological far-from-equilibrium networks, including actively controlled information flows, and establishes a correspondence between active flow networks and generalized ice-type models.},

Here, we demonstrate an approach that combines quantum engineering with single-molecule biophysics to immobilize individual proteins and DNA molecules on the surface of a bulk diamond crystal that hosts coherent nitrogen vacancy qubit sensors. Our thin (sub\textendash 5 nm) functionalization architecture provides precise control over the biomolecule adsorption density and results in near-surface qubit coherence approaching 100 {$\mu$}s. The developed architecture remains chemically stable under physiological conditions for over 5 d, making our technique compatible with most biophysical and biomedical applications.},

Specifically, guided optical waves generate radiation pressure on the liquid interface, which can in turn distort the liquid interface and modify the properties of the optical field. In the first example, we discuss the feasibility of nonlinear optofluidic solitons, where optical field is governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and nonlinearity is effectively determined by liquid properties. Then, we analyze a nonlinear optofluidic process associated with a high quality (Q) factor whispering gallery mode (WGM) in a liquid droplet. Similar to Kerr effects, the WGM can produce a frequency shift proportional to the WGM power. Using liquid properties that are experimentally attainable, we find that it may only take a few photons to generate measurable WGM resonance shift. Such a possibility may eventually lead to nonlinear optics at single photon energy level.},

More recently, electronic forms of computation and information processing have overtaken these mechanical forms, owing to better potential for miniaturization and integration. However, several unconventional computing approaches have recently been introduced, which blend ideas of information processing, materials science and robotics. This has raised the possibility of new mechanical computing~systems that augment traditional electronic computing by interacting with and adapting to their environment. Here we discuss the use of mechanical mechanisms, and associated nonlinearities, as a means of processing information, with a view towards a framework in which adaptable materials and structures act as a distributed information processing network, even enabling information processing to be viewed as a material property, alongside traditional material properties such as strength and stiffness. We focus on approaches to abstract digital logic in mechanical systems, discuss how these systems differ from traditional electronic computing, and highlight the challenges and opportunities that they present.},

The active bath is either explicitly simulated by an ensemble of active Brownian particles or abstractly represented by an active colored noise in theory. Assuming the equivalence of the two descriptions of the active bath, the active noise in the simulation system, which is directly extracted by fitting theoretical predictions to simulation measurements, is shown to depend on the constraint suffered by the passive tracer. This scenario is in significant contrast to the case of thermal noise that is independent of external trap potentials. The constraint dependence of active noise arises from the fact that the persistent force on the passive particle from the active bath can be influenced by the particle relaxation dynamics. Moreover, due to the interplay between the active collisions and particle relaxation dynamics, the effective temperature of the passive tracer quantified as the ratio of fluctuation to dissipation increases as the constraint strengthens, while the average potential and kinetic energies of the passive particle both decrease.},

  abstract = {Microswimmers such as bacteria exhibit large speed fluctuation when exploring their living environment. Here, we show that the bacterium Escherichia coli with a wide range of length speeds up beyond its free-swimming speed when passing through narrow and short confinement. The speedup is observed in two modes: For short bacteria with L{$<$}20{$\mu$}m, the maximum speed occurs when the cell body leaves the confinement but a flagellar bundle is still confined; For longer bacteria (L{$\geq$}20{$\mu$}m), the maximum speed occurs when the middle of the cell, where the maximum number of flagellar bundles locate, is confined. The two speedup modes are explained by a vanishing body drag and an increased flagella drag \textemdash{} a universal property of an 'ideal swimmer'. The spatial variance of speed can be quantitatively explained by a simple model based on the resistance matrix of a partially confined bacterium. The speed change depends on the distribution of motors and the latter is confirmed by fluorescent imaging of flagellar hooks. By measuring the duration of slowdown and speedup, we find that the effective chemotaxis is biased in filamentous bacteria which might benefit their survival. The experimental setup can be useful to study the motion of microswimmers near surfaces with different surface chemistry.},

Confocal microscopy of the bacterial flow fields shows that at high density and activity, they exhibit azimuthal zonal flows which oscillate between counterclockwise and clockwise circulating states. We characterize these oscillatory patterns via their Fourier spectra and the distributions of their circulation persistence times. To explain our observations, we used numerical simulations of active particles and characterize the two-dimensional phase space of bacterial packing fraction and activity associated with persistent collective motions. All together, our study shows how geometric effects lead to new types of collective dynamics.},

  abstract = {Passive filtering is a common strategy to reduce airborne disease transmission and particulate contaminants across scales spanning orders of magnitude. The engineering of high-performance filters with relatively low flow resistance but high virus- or particle-blocking efficiency is a non-trivial problem of paramount relevance, as evidenced in the variety of industrial filtration systems and face masks. Next-generation industrial filters and masks should retain sufficiently small droplets and aerosols while having low resistance. We introduce a novel 3D-printable particle filter inspired by animals' complex nasal anatomy. Unlike standard random-media-based filters, the proposed concept relies on equally spaced channels with tortuous airflow paths. These two strategies induce distinct effects: a reduced resistance and a high likelihood of particle trapping by altering their trajectories with tortuous paths and induced local flow instability. The structures are tested for pressure drop and particle filtering efficiency over different airflow rates. We have also cross-validated the observed efficiency through numerical simulations. We found that the designed filters exhibit a lower pressure drop, compared to commercial masks and filters, while capturing particles bigger than approximately 10 {$\mu$}m. Our findings could facilitate a novel and scalable filter concept inspired by animal noses.},

One of the crucial biological structures for survivability is the nose, which efficiently transports and thermally preconditions the external air before reaching the internal body. Nasal mucosa and cavity help warm and humidify the inhaled air quickly. Despite its crucial role, the morphological features of mammal noses and their effect in modulating the momentum of the inhaled air, heat transfer dynamics, and particulate trapping remain poorly understood. Tortuosity of the nasal cavity in high-olfactory mammalian species, such as pigs and opossum, facilitates the formation of complex airflow patterns inside the nasal cavity, which leads to the screening of particulates from the inhaled air. We explored basic nasal features in anatomically realistic nasal pathways, including tortuosity, radius of curvature, and gap thickness; they show strong power-law correlations with body weight. Complementary inspection of tortuosity with idealized conduits reveals that this quantity is central in particle capture efficiency. Mechanistic insights into such nuances can serve as a tipping point to transforming nature-based designs into practical applications. In-depth characterization of the fluid\textendash particle interactions in nasal cavities is necessary to uncover nose mechanistic functionalities. It is instrumental in developing new devices and filters in a number of engineering processes.},

Various issues interact here, such as dynamics of the contact line, evaporation-induced phase transitions, and formation of patterns. The explanation of the rich variety of patterns formed is not only an academic challenge, but also a problem of practical importance, as applications are growing in medical diagnosis and improvement of coating/printing technology. The multi-scale aspect of the problem is emphasized in this review. The specific fundamental problem to be solved, related to the system is the investigation of the mass transfer processes, the formation and evolution of phase fronts and the identification of mechanisms of pattern formation. To understand these problems, we introduce the important forces and interactions involved in these processes, and highlight the evaporation-driven phase transitions and flows in the drop. We focus on how the deposited patterns are related to and tuned by important factors, for instance substrate properties and contents of the drop. In addition, the formation of crust and crack patterns are discussed. The simulation and modeling methods, which are often utilized in this topic, are also reviewed. Finally, we summarize the applications of drop evaporation and suggest several potential directions for future research in this area. Exploiting the full potential of this topic in basic science research and applications needs involvement and interaction between scientists and engineers from disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and other related fields.},

During evaporation, due to the stretching effect of the liquid zone, the receding wet front leads to the formation of radialized surface wrinkling in the gel zone. This indicates the building of a macroscopic stress field with a similar distribution. As a result, the cracks in the deposited films are in a radial arrangement. The propagation velocity of the cracks depends on the thickness of the film, {$\sim$} H3/5. In addition, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) additives can be used to tune crack behavior by causing a reduction of the capillary force between particles.

The flow velocity gradient over the length of polymer chains can be nonuniform and continuum models of polymeric liquids break in this limit. In this work, we use Brownian dynamics simulations to study a rotating helical flagellum in a polymer solution and overcome this limitation. As the polymer size increases, the viscosity experienced by the flagellum asymptotically reduces to the solvent viscosity. The contribution of polymer molecules to the local viscosity in a solution of long polymer chains decreases with the inverse of polymer size to the power 1/2. The difference in viscosity experienced by the bacterial cell body and flagella can predict the nonmonotonic swimming speed of bacteria in polymer solutions.},

In this paper, we studied the evaporation and pattern formation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) colloid droplets on smooth substrate and rough substrates with different roughness. We found that the evaporation of droplets shows remarkable coffee-ring effect on smooth substrate and that the cross-section of the ring is wedge-shaped with its thickness decreasing from the edge to the center. However, with increasing roughness, the effect strengthened, with the section of the coffee-ring changing from wedge- to hill-shaped. The contact angle decreased with increasing roughness, leading to an increase in evaporation rate. Moreover, wicking led to additional evaporation, which also enhanced capillary flow, moving more particles to the edge. In addition, the rough structure of the substrate inhibited the back-flow of the capillary flow, preventing the particles' move to the center. The formation of radial wrinkles on the edge also led to particle retention, preventing them from moving to the center. All these factors contribute to the decreased width and increased height of the coffee-ring pattern after evaporation on rough surfaces. It is an effective method to regulate the deposition pattern of evaporating droplet by changing the substrate roughness.},

  abstract = {An active colloidal fluid composed of self-propelled spinning particles injecting energy and angular momentum at the microscale demonstrates spontaneous collective states that range from flocks to coherent vortices. Despite their seeming simplicity, the emergent far-from-equilibrium behavior of these fluids remains poorly understood, presenting a challenge to the design and control of next-generation active materials. When confined in a ring, such so-called polar active fluids acquire chirality once the spontaneous flow chooses a direction. In a perfect ring, this chirality is indefinitely long-lived. Here, we combine experiments on self-propelled colloidal Quincke rollers and mesoscopic simulations of continuum Toner-Tu equations to explore how such chiral states can be controlled and manipulated by obstacles. For different obstacle geometries, three dynamic steady states have been realized: long-lived chiral flow, an apolar state in which the flow breaks up into counter-rotating vortices, and an unconventional collective state with flow having an oscillating chirality. The chirality reversal proceeds through the formation of intermittent vortex chains in the vicinity of an obstacle. We demonstrate that the frequency of collective states with oscillating chirality can be tuned by obstacle parameters. We vary obstacle shapes to design chiral states that are independent of initial conditions. Building on our findings, we realize a system with two triangular obstacles that force the active fluid toward a state with a density imbalance of active particles across the ring. Our results demonstrate how spontaneous polar active flows in combination with size and geometry of scatterers can be used to control dynamic patterns of polar active liquids for materials design.},

The complexity of the accessible dynamic states is expected to dramatically increase in the case of chiral active units. Here, we use shape anisotropy of colloidal particles to introduce chiral rollers with activity-controlled curvatures of their trajectories and spontaneous handedness of their motion. By controlling activity through variations of the energizing electric field, we reveal emergent dynamic phases, ranging from a gas of spinners to aster-like vortices and rotating flocks, with either polar or nematic alignment of the particles. We demonstrate control and reversibility of these dynamic states by activity. Our findings provide insights into the onset of spatial and temporal coherence in a broad class of active chiral systems, both living and synthetic, and hint at design pathways for active materials based on self-organization and reconfigurability.},

These asymmetries can be exploited to systematically command subsequent polar states of active liquids through temporal control of the activity.},

Here we develop a variational method to generate metrological states in small dipolar-interacting spin ensembles with limited qubit control. For both regular and disordered spatial spin configurations the generated states enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) and, for small spin numbers, approach the Heisenberg limit (HL). Depending on the circuit depth and the level of readout noise, the resulting states resemble Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states or Spin Squeezed States (SSS). Sensing beyond the SQL holds in the presence of finite spin polarization and a non-Markovian noise environment. The developed black-box optimization techniques for small spin numbers (               N               \,{$\leq$}\,10) are directly applicable to diamond-based nanoscale field sensing, where the sensor size limits               N               and conventional squeezing approaches fail.},

  abstract = {Flagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis exhibit effective mechanisms for swimming in fluids and exploring the surrounding environment. In isotropic fluids such as water, the bacteria change swimming direction through the run-and-tumble process. Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) have been introduced recently as an anisotropic environment in which the direction of preferred orientation, the director, guides the bacterial trajectories. In this work, we describe the behavior of bacteria B. subtilis in a homeotropic LCLC geometry, in which the director is perpendicular to the bounding plates of a shallow cell. We demonstrate that the bacteria are capable of overcoming the stabilizing elastic forces of the LCLC and swim perpendicularly to the imposed director (and parallel to the bounding plates). The effect is explained by a finite surface anchoring of the director at the bacterial body; the role of surface anchoring is analyzed by numerical simulations of a rod realigning in an otherwise uniform director field. Shear flows produced by a swimming bacterium cause director distortions around its body, as evidenced both by experiments and numerical simulations. These distortions contribute to a repulsive force that keeps the swimming bacterium at a distance of a few micrometers away from the bounding plates. The homeotropic alignment of the director imposes two different scenarios of bacterial tumbling: one with an 180\textdegree{} reversal of the horizontal velocity and the other with the realignment of the bacterium by two consecutive 90\textdegree{} turns. In the second case, the angle between the bacterial body and the imposed director changes from 90\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree{} and then back to 90\textdegree; the new direction of swimming does not correlate with the previous swimming direction. Introduction and background. Flagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis exhibit effective mechanisms for swimming. These bacteria explore the isotropic fluid environment such as water by a run-and-tumble mode of swimming. Lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) have been introduced recently as an anisotropic environment that guides the bacteria to swim along the director, i.e. the axis of the liquid crystal alignment. Main result(s). In this work, we demonstrate that B. subtilis can also swim perpendicularly to the director, when placed in the so-called homeotropic cells, in which the director is perpendicular to the bounding plates. The ability of the bacteria to overcome the stabilizing elastic forces of the LCLC is explained by a relatively weak surface anchoring of the director at the bacterial body. Shear flows produced by a swimming bacterium cause quadrupolar distortions of the surrounding LCLC. These distortions stabilize the horizontal orientation of the bacterium and repel it from the bounding plates. The homeotropic alignment of the director imposes two different scenarios of bacterial tumbling: one with an 180\textdegree{} reversal of the horizontal velocity and the other with the realignment of the bacterium by flip-flops. Wider implications. The experiments demonstrate that the dynamic activity of bacteria can be effectively controlled by the surrounding anisotropic environment, thus opening opportunities for designing spatiotemporal behavior and development of materials and systems with an efficient transformation of chemical energy into sustained mechanical motion and useful work.

Perpendicular or parallel orientations to the surface lead to dipole-like or quadrupole-like defect structures. However, the so-called elastic hexadecapole discovered recently, has been assumed to result from a conic anchoring condition. In order to understand it at a fundamental level, a model for this anchoring is introduced here in the context of a Landau-de Gennes free energy functional. We investigate the evolution of defect configurations, as well as colloidal interactions, by tuning the preferred tilt angle (\texttheta e). The model predicts an elastic dipole whose stability decreases as \texttheta e increases, along with a dipole-hexadecapole transformation, which are confirmed by our experimental observations. Taken together, our results suggest that previously unanticipated avenues may exist for design of self-assembled structures via control of tilt angle.},

Methods for droplet generation can be either passive or active, where the former generates droplets without external actuation, and the latter makes use of additional energy input in promoting interfacial instabilities for droplet generation. A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms. Also included in this review is the contrast among different approaches of either passive or active nature.},
