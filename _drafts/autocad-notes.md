### AutoCAD notes

- First try of the 3-node design

![practice channel design](../images/2022/10/practice-channel-design.png)

- an idea to reuse design: design a base (circular), then subtract a channel out of the base. For example, the following design can be made by simply subtract a premade base:

- To create a different design, just subtract the cylinder with the channel shape (200 um height).
